  GREECE.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href=

  <p>The appearance of a new history of Greece, of the pretensions, and
  the just pretensions, of this of Mr Grote, is an event in literature
  which must not pass by without some note or comment. Never were
  historical studies pursued with so much success, or in so
  philosophical a spirit, as in the present day, and that by the whole
  corps of European scholarship, whether German, or French, or English;
  and it is saying much, when we say of the work before us, that it is
  equal to the demands of the critical age in which it appears, and
  that in just estimate of historical testimony, and in true
  appreciation of the spirit of past times, it is as superior to its
  predecessors as, in these very points, the nineteenth century is in
  advance of all preceding centuries.</p>

  <p>The progress made in this department of study is very perceptible
  in the several histories we possess of Greece. Mitford,
  notwithstanding his acknowledged imperfections and demerits, has had
  the tribute of applause paid to him, and deservedly, of having been
  the first to break through that icy timidity with which the moderns
  were wont to write the annals of ancient Greece. They seemed to be
  afraid of applying the knowledge which time and science had brought
  them, to the events and writings of a classical age and country, lest
  this should imply the presumption that they were wiser than the
  ancients. They sat down to their task like young scholars who are
  <i>construing</i>, not interpreting, their author. Little
  discrimination was made between the learned writings before them. If
  it was not, as it has been wittily observed, &quot;all Greek, and
  therefore all true,&quot; at least every thing that was Greek had a
  mysterious air of learning which protected it from profane
  examination; and incongruities and futilities, absurdities of
  reasoning, and improbabilities of narrative, were veiled or half
  concealed under the charm of Grecian typography. Mitford set aside
  this too great reverence for the ancient literati. As he saw men, and
  not moving statues, in the heroes of Grecian history, so he was
  persuaded that the writers of that history were also men, fallible
  and prejudiced, like those who were living and writing about him. But
  Mitford overcame one set of prejudices by the force which prejudices
  of another kind had endowed him with. He saw how party spirit had
  raged in modern as well as ancient times, but he detected it with
  that proverbial readiness with which the thief detects the thief; he
  wrote himself with the energy and penetration, the want of candour
  and generosity, which at all times will distinguish the advocate.
  Moreover, the scholarship of Europe has since his time assumed so
  lofty a port, and taken such rapid strides, that on many subjects he
  has been left lagging in the rear.</p>

  <p>The history of Greece by Dr <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span> Thirlwall is a great
  improvement on its predecessor. It is written with profounder
  learning, and a more equitable spirit; and is indeed pre-eminently
  distinguished by the calmness, candour, and judge-like serenity that
  pervades it. In a style always lucid in disquisition, and always
  elegant in narrative, he appears to be solely anxious to communicate
  the fair result, whatever it may be, to which his extensive reading
  has conducted him. But, unfortunately, Dr Thirlwall wrote his history
  in one of those <i>transition states</i> of mind which render
  impossible the accomplishment of an enduring work. He saw the
  futility of much that had been relied on as basis of historical
  belief; he was not disposed to credulity, nor at all likely to accept
  fable, in its own simple and gross form, for truth. But he had not
  taught himself to forego the vain attempt to extract history out of
  fable; he could not relinquish that habit of &quot;learned
  conjecture,&quot; so dear to the scholar, so fatal to the historian.
  In the earlier portion of his work, he constructs his narrative under
  the singular disadvantage of one who sees perpetually the weakness of
  his own superstructure, yet continues to build on; and thus, with
  much show of scaffolding, and after much putting up and pulling down,
  he leaves at last but little standing on the soil. He had not laid
  down for himself a previous rule for determining what should be
  admitted as historical evidence, or the rules he had prescribed for
  himself were of an uncertain, fluctuating character. Neither do we
  discover in Dr Thirlwall the faculty, existing at least in any
  eminent degree, of realising to himself, or vividly representing to
  others, the intellectual condition of a nascent people, far removed
  from ourselves in habits of thought, and trained under quite
  different institutions, religious and political. In short, we note a
  deficiency&#8212;(to adopt the phraseology of Bacon)&#8212;in what we
  may be allowed to describe, as the more philosophical qualifications
  of the historian.</p>

  <p>Precisely in these lies the peculiar strength of Mr Grote. With
  scholarship as extensive as that of his predecessors, he has united a
  stricter discipline of mind, and habits of closer reasoning; and he
  manifests a truer perception of the nature of past modes of
  thinking&#8212;of the intellectual life of unlettered and Pagan ages.
  He has passed through that <i>transition state</i> in which Dr
  Thirlwall unfortunately found himself, and has drawn with a firm hand
  the boundaries between history and fable. Not only has he drawn the
  line, and determined the principle on which the limits of the
  historical world should be marked out, but he has had the fortitude
  to adhere to his own principles, and has not allowed himself, in
  pursuit of some fragment of historic truth, (many of which doubtless
  lie in a half-discovered state beyond the circle he has drawn,) to
  transgress the boundary he has wisely prescribed to himself. The
  history is not far enough advanced to enable us to judge whether Mr
  Grote will preserve himself from a political bias, the opposite of
  that which has been so much censured in Mitford. A sufficient portion
  however, is published, to authorise us in saying that it is not in
  point of <i>narrative</i> that the present author will obtain any
  advantage over his predecessors. It is in disquisition that he
  rejoices, and succeeds; it is the argumentative matter which excites
  and sustains him. His style seems to languish when the effort of
  ratiocination gives place to the task of the narrator. We fancy we
  see him resume the pen with listlessness, when nothing remains for
  the historian but to tell his story.</p>

  <p>Neither can we congratulate Mr Grote on possessing the art of
  arrangement or compression, on the knowing when to abbreviate, or how
  to omit. His subject has in itself this unavoidable disadvantage,
  that the history of Greece lies scattered and broken up amongst many
  independent cities and communities: this disadvantage our
  author&#39;s voluminous and discursive manner does nothing to remedy,
  does much to aggravate. One would almost suspect that Mr Grote had
  entertained the idea that it belonged to the history of Greece to
  give us an account of all that the Greeks knew of history. It seems
  sufficient that a subject has been mentioned by Herodotus to entitle
  it to a place in his pages. This fulness of matter, it may be said,
  will enrich the work. Very true. But <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span> what if, in this process
  of enriching, the work be made unreadable? What if the treasures be
  so piled up and heaped together that to get at them may be little
  less difficult than to extract the precious metals originally from
  the mine? If the work advance on the plan hitherto pursued, it will
  be found that, &quot;A History of Greece&quot; is far too restricted
  a title, and that it should rather have been called a history of the
  ancient world during the times when the Greeks rose and
  flourished;&#8212;so well disposed does the author appear to wander
  over to Ph&#339;nicia and Assyria, to Babylon and Egypt. Mr Alison
  might as well have entitled his great historical work simply a
  history of the French Revolution. It is true, there is no reason to
  be given why Mr Grote should not do for ancient Europe during the
  period of the development of the Greeks, what Mr Alison has done for
  modern Europe during the great drama enacted by the people of France.
  Unhappily, however, Mr Grote does not possess those descriptive
  powers which, in the work of Mr Alison, render the parts which are
  most episodical, invariably the most interesting; so that, however
  important and eventful the main stream of his narrative may be, a
  reader of Alison always delights to find the author starting afresh
  from some remote era, on some distant soil, and call willingly quit
  even Paris and her Revolution, to revisit with him the rustic
  republics of Switzerland, or to build up Holland again from the sea,
  or to call to life the people of Poland, and fill the plains again
  with their strange military diet of a hundred thousand mounted
  senators.</p>

  <p>There is much of the philosopher, little of the artist, in Mr.
  Grote; nor are the charms of style those which he has sedulously
  cultivated, or by which he is anxious to obtain attention. He writes
  in a manly, straightforward manner, and expresses his meaning with
  sufficient force and perspicuity: but there is no sustained elegance
  of diction; there is often all apparent disdain of it. At least we
  meet occasionally with quite conversational expressions,
  introduced&#8212;not, be it remarked, with that dexterous ease and
  felicitous taste which render them so effective in compositions of
  the highest order&#8212;but bluntly, carelessly, as if they were
  verily the first that came to hand, and the author did not think it
  worth his while to look for others. It should be mentioned, however,
  that this inequality of style is partly the effect of a desire to
  keep as close as possible in his narrative to the original Greek, so
  that it is the crudeness of <i>translation</i> we sometimes
  encounter. We raise no quarrel with him ourselves on this point; his
  language, in general, is all that is requisite; but a critic disposed
  to be severe on the minor delinquencies of style, might justify his
  censure by extracting many a hasty and neglected sentence, and many
  all uncouth expression. In fine, we accept of the present work as a
  valuable contribution to the history of Greece, and to the science
  itself of history; we accept it as a manifest improvement upon its
  predecessors in some of the highest and most important elements of
  historical composition; but we by no means accept it as <i>the</i>
  History of Greece, as the final narrative of the people of Athens and
  Sparta. For this it is too polemical, diffuse, incondite. On the
  ground which this writer and others have been obliged to contend for,
  which they have conquered and cleared, our posterity will one day, it
  is to be hoped, see a structure arise&#8212;grand, and simple, and
  yet ornate. For if the fitness of things be a rule for our
  expectation, we may safely prophesy that some future age will possess
  a History of Greece which will be to all other histories what the
  Grecian temple is to all other temples; which shall be itself a
  temple worthy of the memory of the most extraordinary people that
  have yet appeared upon the earth.</p>

  <p>Mr Grote has done in the history of Greece what Dr Arnold did in
  that of Rome: he has at once excluded the early legends entirely from
  the class of historical records. The outcry which we sometimes hear
  against that scepticism which has resulted from later and more severe
  investigations into the nature of historical evidence, and the loss
  thereby sustained of many a popular tale, is&#8212;need we insist
  upon it?&#8212;mere childishness. It is never found that we lose any
  thing by truth, and certainly not here. The popular <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span> tale,
  legend, or myth, may be displaced entirely from the records of the
  past, (for what it contains, or may be supposed to contain, of fact
  or event;) but it remains with us in its true character of fable, as
  the offspring of the teeming invention and the ready faith of an
  unlettered generation; and, in this character, is more thoroughly
  understood by our present race of thinkers, and more vividly
  appreciated, than it ever was before. But shall we believe
  <i>nothing</i> of it?&#8212;surely something, must be true,&#8212;is
  the whole legend to be lost? To such exclamations we answer, that the
  whole legend, instead of being lost, is regained, is restored to us.
  While you doubt of its true nature, and strive to make it speak the
  language of history, you can never see the legend itself,&#8212;never
  clearly understand it,&#8212;never gather from it the curious
  knowledge it is able to reveal of our own species. If, instead of
  looking askance at the bold inventions of past times, with a half
  faith and a half denial, busied with tricks of interpretation, and
  teased with ever-recurring incredulity, you embrace it cordially as
  the genuine product of an imaginative age, redolent of the
  marvellous, you will, as such, gather from it a far higher and more
  profitable instruction than could be extracted from some supposed
  historic fact which it is thought to conceal, and which is received
  as credible on the very ground that it resembles a host of similar
  facts already well established.</p>

  <p>We heartily approve and applaud the resolute abstinence with which
  Mr Grote has refrained from seeking for some supposed historical
  basis in mere legend and fable; we believe that his work, in this
  point of view, is calculated to have an excellent influence, not only
  on all future historians of Greece, but on all who shall undertake to
  write the early history of any people whatever. With the exception of
  Dr Arnold&#39;s History of Rome, we know of no work where there is
  the same true appreciation shown of the real value, and proper use,
  of legendary traditions. Certainly amongst the great scholars of
  Germany, whatever their undoubted merits in other respects, there is
  very little of this wise reticence, this philosophical forbearance;
  and if the two English historians, whom we have named together, be
  surpassed in critical knowledge by the learned men of Germany, or in
  brilliant narrative by the writers of France, they are superior to
  their contemporaries in both countries in the sound application of
  learning to ancient history, and their attachment to the sobriety of
  truth. With much less show of philosophic <i>system</i>, they have
  more of philosophy.</p>

  <p>&quot;The times which I have thus set apart,&quot; writes Mr
  Grote, in his preface, &quot;from the region of history, are
  discernible only through a different atmosphere&#8212;that of epic
  poetry and legend. To confound together these disparate matters is,
  in my judgment, essentially unphilosophical. I describe the earlier
  times by themselves, as conceived by the faith and feeling of the
  first Greek, and known only through their legends,&#8212;without
  presuming to measure how much or how little of historical matter
  these legends may contain. If the reader blame me for not assisting
  him to determine this,&#8212;if he ask me why I do not undraw the
  curtain and disclose the picture,&#8212;I reply in the words of the
  painter Zeuxis, when the same question was addressed to him, on
  exhibiting his master-piece of imitative art&#8212;&#39;The curtain
  <i>is</i> the picture.&#39; What we now read as poetry and legend was
  once accredited history, and the only genuine history which the first
  Greeks could conceive or relish of their past time: the curtain
  conceals nothing behind, and cannot by any ingenuity be withdrawn. I
  undertake only to show it as it stands,&#8212;not to efface, still
  less to repaint it.&quot;</p>

  <p>A simple uninstructed age believes its own legend; it asks no
  question upon the point of credibility; with such an age, to hear, is
  to believe. Originally, indeed, with all of us, to have a conception
  of any thing is tantamount to believing that it exists, or has
  existed: belief is no separate act of mind, but is itself included in
  the perception or the thought; it is experience and reflection which
  have to ingraft their <i>disbelief</i>, and teach us that every thing
  we <i>think</i> is not equally <i>true</i>. An ignorant people are
  all children, and with <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id=
  "Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>them there is but one rule of faith:
  the more vivid the impression, the stronger the belief,&#8212;the
  more marvellous the story, the less possibility of doubting it. And
  consider this&#8212;that we, owing to our scientific habits of
  thought, and the long record of the by-gone world which lies open to
  us, entertain it as a general law, that the past has, in certain
  essentials, resembled the present; but our unlettered people, looking
  out into the blank foretime, would have no such law to regulate or
  restrain their belief. On the contrary, their impression would
  naturally be, that the past was, essentially different from the
  present, or why was it <i>past</i>? Why all this change and
  transiency, if the same things were to be repeated? All people that
  have had no records have filled up the void with beings and events as
  unlike as possible to those they were familiar with. They had a
  prevailing impression that that blank space was the region of the
  wonderful; and the day-dreamer, the imaginative man, who was,
  naturally enough, proclaimed to be inspired, since none could tell
  how his knowledge came, was generally at hand to fill up the blank
  space with appropriate picture.</p>

  <p>An age of awakening criticism begins to find the legend
  doubtful&#8212;cannot entirely believe, cannot entirely dismiss the
  old familiar story,&#8212;begins to interpret it as allegory, or to
  separate the probable incidents from the improbable, receiving the
  first, rejecting the second. A new rule of faith has been introduced;
  not what is most captivating and strange, but what best harmonises
  with the common occurrences of life, is to be the most readily
  believed. The exuberant legend is therefore pruned down and
  mutilated, or it is represented as the fantastic shadow of some quite
  natural circumstance,&#8212;strange shadow for such
  substance!&#8212;and in this state it is admitted to a certain
  credence. But who sees not that this is no separation of history from
  fable, but merely a reduction of the fable into something we can
  pronounce to be probable? But the probability of this residue is no
  sufficient ground for our belief; no one, surely, supposes that
  imagination deals in nothing but impossibilities. The utmost effort,
  the wildest flight of fancy, could not always keep clear of
  probability; and it would be strange indeed if the romantic fiction
  could claim our faith at every point where, by chance, it had touched
  the earth. One might as well sift, in the same manner, a fiction of
  the Arabian Nights; and, setting aside the supernatural, admit
  whatever is natural to be true. The wonderful properties of
  Aladdin&#39;s lamp shall be given up; but that Aladdin had an old
  lamp, and that his wife sold it when he was out of the way, this
  shall remain admissible.</p>

  <p>A third age, however, arrives, still more critical, more justly
  and profoundly analytic. It recognises that, by the process just
  described, a dead residuum of little value and doubtful reality is
  the utmost that can be obtained, While the real value of the subject
  of this untutored chemistry has been lost in the experiment. It
  returns to the legend&#8212;contemplates it in its entire, and
  genuine form. It sees that the legend is the true history of the
  minds that created and believed it&#8212;a very important
  history&#8212;but of little or nothing else. Seen in this light,
  there is, indeed, no comparison between the value of the poetic fable
  as a contribution to the history of mankind, and the value of the
  prosaic and ordinary fact which a half critical age (if sure of its
  <i>guess</i>) would extract from it. Think for a moment of all the
  marvels of the Argonautic expedition; that vessel, itself sentient
  and intelligent, having its prophet as well as pilot on board,
  darting through rocks which move and join together, like huge
  pincers, to crush the passing ship; think of the wondrous Medea who
  conducted the homeward voyage, and reflect upon the sort of people
  who created and credited all these marvels. Then turn to the
  semi-critical version of Strabo, where the whole expedition resolves
  itself into an invasion of some unknown king, of some unknown
  country, whose wealth stands typified in the golden fleece. Such
  writers as Strabo commit a two-fold error. They corrupt history, and
  they destroy the legend. They write an unauthorised narrative, and
  explain the nature and genius of the fable in a manner equally
  unauthorised.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id=
  "Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

  <p>Or take an instance still more familiar. The legend tells us that
  Romulus&#8212;as was thought befitting the founder of Rome&#8212;died
  in no ordinary manner, but was translated to the skies. He had called
  the people together on the field of Mars, &quot;when,&quot; in the
  simple language which Dr Arnold has appropriated to these legendary
  stories&#8212;&quot;when all on a sudden there arose a dreadful
  storm, and all was dark as night; and the rain, and the thunder, and
  the lightning, were so terrible that all the people fled from the
  field, and ran to their homes. At last the storm was over, and they
  came back to the field of Mars, but Romulus was nowhere to be found,
  for Mars, his father, had carried him up to heaven in his
  chariot.&quot; Dionysius the Greek found, in this mysterious
  disappearance, a proof of the assassination of Romulus by certain of
  his nobles, who stabbed him and conveyed him away in the
  thunder-storm. And our own Hooke thought himself equally sagacious,
  in his day, when he adopted this interpretation. But what is it that
  we have here? Not history certainly; and as little an intelligent
  view of the fable.</p>

  <p>What Hooke did, in his day, occasionally, and in an empirical
  manner, some German literati have attempted in a quite systematic,
  <i>a priori</i> fashion. They first determine that the myth or legend
  has been composed by a certain play of the imagination&#8212;as the
  representing the history of a people, or a tribe, under the personal
  adventures of an imaginary being; and then they hope to unravel this
  work of the fancy, and get back again the raw material of plain
  truth. If they are partially correct in describing this to have been
  <i>one</i> course the imagination pursued&#8212;which is all that can
  be admitted&#8212;still the attempt is utterly hopeless to recover,
  in its first shape, what has been confessedly disguised and
  distorted. The naturalists of Laputa were justified in supposing that
  the light of the sun had much to do with the growth of gerkins, but
  it does not follow that they would succeed in their project of
  &quot;extracting sunbeams out of cucumbers.&quot;</p>

  <p>For the <i>briefest</i> illustration we can call to mind of this
  philosophical ingenuity, we will refer the reader to Michelet&#39;s
  preface to his History of Rome. We see the absurdity none the worse
  for it being presented through the transparent medium of the French
  writer. He thus explains the discovery of the learned Germans whom he
  follows:&#8212;&quot;Ce qu&#39;il y a de plus original, c&#39;est
  d&#39;avoir prouvÃ© que ces fictions historiques Ã©taient une necÃ©ssitÃ©
  de notre nature. L&#39;humanitÃ© d&#39;abord matÃ©rielle et grossiÃ¨re,
  ne pouvait dans les langues encore toutes concrÃ¨tes, exprimer la
  pensÃ©e abstraite, qu&#39;en la rÃ©alisant, en lui donnant un corps,
  une personalitÃ© humaine, un nom propre. Le mÃªme besoin do
  simplification, si naturel Ã  la faiblesse, fit aussi dÃ©signer une
  collection d&#39;individus par un nom d&#39;homme. Cet homme
  mythique, ce fils de la pensÃ©e populaire, exprima Ã  la fois le peuple
  et l&#39;idÃ©e du peuple. Romulus c&#39;Ã©tait la force, et le peuple
  de la force; Juda, l&#39;Ã©lection divine et le peuple Ã©lu.&quot;</p>

  <p>Having thus expounded the theory of the construction of a myth, he
  afterwards tries his hand upon the resolution of one into its
  constituent elements. The fourth chapter of his introduction
  commences thus:&#8212;&quot;CircÃ©, dit HÃ©siode, (<i>Theog.</i> v.
  1111, 1115) eut d&#39;Ulysse deux fils, Latinos et Agrios (le
  barbare,) qui au fond des saintes Ã®les gouvenÃ¨rent la race cÃ©lÃ¨bre
  des TyrsÃ©niens. J&#39;enterprÃ¨terais volontiers ce passage de la
  maniÃ¨re suivante: Des Pelasges, navigateurs et magiciens,
  (c&#39;est-Ã -dire, industrieux) sortirent les deux grandes sociÃ©tÃ©s
  Italiennes&#8212;les <i>Osci</i>, (dont les Latins sont une tribu,)
  et les Tusci ou Etrusques. CircÃ©, fille du soleil, a tous les
  caractÃ¨res d&#39;une Telchine PÃ©lasgique. Le poete nous la montre
  prÃ¨s d&#39;un grand feu, rarement utile dans un pays chaud, si ce
  n&#39;est pour un but industriel; elle file la toile, ou prÃ©pare de
  puissants breuvages.&quot;</p>

  <p>The theory and the application, it will be seen, are worthy of
  each other. All comment would be superfluous. We have preferred to
  retain the original language for this, amongst other reasons, that we
  should have found it difficult to represent in honest English the
  exact degree of affirmation to which the Frenchman pledges himself by
  his &quot;j&#39;enterpreterais volontiers.&quot; It is something less
  than conviction, and something more than <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
  guess;&#8212;it certainly should be, or it ought to have no place in
  history.</p>

  <p>It is not by mangling the legend, or by predicating of it
  fantastic modes of construction, that the few grains of sober fact
  concealed about it are to be secured; but by studying honestly the
  laws of imagination under which all fabulous narratives are
  constructed. However wildly the fancy may range in the main events of
  a fable, there will be always a certain portion of the details
  gathered from real life; and the manners and morals of an age may be
  depicted in fictions, the substance of which is altogether
  supernatural. The heroes fight like gods, but they dine and dress
  like ordinary mortals. Achilles drags the body of Hector three times
  round the walls of Troy, both armies looking on the while. Such sight
  the earth never beheld. But the ear of the warrior and the harness of
  his steeds resembled such as had been seen or heard of. The poet
  invents a centaur, but not the bow and arrow he puts into his hands.
  His hero scales the sky, but carries with him the sandal on his foot
  which was made in the village below.</p>

  <p>&quot;Three-fourths of the two volumes now presented to the
  public,&quot; continues Mr Grote in his preface, &quot;are destined
  to elucidate this age of historical faith as distinguished from the
  later age of historical reason: to exhibit its basis in the human
  mind&#8212;an omnipresent religious and personal interpretation of
  nature; to illustrate it by comparison with the like mental habit in
  early modern Europe; to show its immense abundance and variety of
  narrative matter, with little care for consistency between one story
  and another; lastly, to set forth the causes which overgrew, and
  partially supplanted the old epical sentiment, and introduced, in the
  room of literal faith, a variety of compromises and
  interpretations.&quot; This is the just application of the legends of
  Greece, forming, as they do, the very best description of the people
  whose exploits and career the author is about to narrate. This is a
  truer commencement of the history than that which appears at first
  sight more strictly historical&#8212;namely, an investigation into
  the obscure tribes which inhabited the same country prior to that
  people who are known to us as Greeks&#8212;an investigation that is
  to be carried on by strained interpretations of these very legends.
  We congratulate both author and reader on this escape from the
  fruitless entanglement of the Pelasgian controversy. Mr Grote seems
  to have taken due warning from the difficulties and embarrassments in
  which his predecessor has here involved himself. Dr Thirlwall is a
  judicious, a succinct, and lucid writer, and yet a more tedious,
  confused, and utterly unsatisfactory piece of history no man can read
  than the account he gives us, in his opening volume, of the
  Pelasgians. The subject is clearly hopeless. From the first sentence
  to the last of that account, a painful confusion attends upon the
  reader&#8212;not the fault, we are ready to believe, of the
  historian, unless it be a fault to attempt a statement of facts where
  the materials for such a statement do not exist. &quot;The
  people&quot;&#8212;Dr Thirlwall thus commences&#8212;&quot;whom we
  call Greeks&#8212;the Hellenes&#8212;were not, <i>at least under this
  name</i>, the first inhabitants of Greece. Many names have been
  recorded of races that preceded them there, which they in later times
  considered barbarous, or foreign in language and manners to
  themselves.&quot; Here the very first sentence proclaims a doubt how
  far the change was one of race or only of name, and this doubt
  pursues us throughout the whole inquiry. It is never solved by the
  author, but is sometimes <i>forgotten</i> by him; for he occasionally
  proceeds with the discussion as if he had left no such doubt behind
  him undetermined. At one time he states distinctly, &quot;we find
  that though in early times Thessaly, and the north of Greece in
  general, was the scene of frequent migrations and revolutions so that
  its ancient inhabitants may here and there have been completely
  displaced by new tribes, Attica appears never to have undergone such
  a change; and Peloponnesus lost no considerable part of its original
  population till long after the whole had become Hellenic.&quot; (P.
  54.) Herodotus had said that certain Pelasgians living in his time
  spoke a language different from the Greeks. Dr Thirlwall puts the
  passage of Herodotus upon the rack to extract from it a confession
  that the difference was not <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136"
  id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span> greater than between one dialect of
  Greek from another. Yet, as the narrative proceeds&#8212;if narrative
  it can be called&#8212;we have the Pelasgians and the Greeks
  represented as essentially distinct people; and we hear of the
  difficulty of determining &quot;the precise point of civilisation to
  which the Pelasgians had advanced, before the Greeks overtook and
  outstripped them.&quot; The whole treatise, notwithstanding the air
  of decision now and then assumed, is but an amplification of the
  doubt implied in the very first sentence of it.</p>

  <p>The legends which fill up the dark space with <i>eponymous</i>
  heroes, as they have been called&#8212;heroes who take the name of a
  tribe in order to bestow it back upon the tribe; for it was the Greek
  mode of thinking at these early periods to presume that every tribe,
  or <i>gens</i>, had a common progenitor from whom it took its title
  and origin,&#8212;these legends are at one time treated with the due
  suspicion which should attend upon them; yet, at another, if a
  fortunate congruity, some lucky &quot;dovetailing,&quot; can be
  observed amongst them, they are raised into the rank of historical
  evidence. The mode of interpretation which we have described as
  characterising the first and undisciplined age of critical inquiry,
  is not laid aside. Such personages as Danaus and Ã†olus are still
  referred to on emergency; and Dr Thirlwall still speaks of the
  Centaurs as &quot;a fabulous race, which, however, may be supposed to
  represent the earlier and ruder inhabitants of the land.&quot; If we
  must call in the Centaurs to our assistance, we may safely conclude
  with Mr Grote that the ancient Pelasgians are &quot;not
  knowable.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Whoever,&quot; writes our author, when the course of his
  narrative brings him to speak of the anti-Hellenic
  tribes&#8212;&quot;Whoever has examined the many conflicting systems
  respecting the Pelasgi&#8212;from the literal belief of Clavier,
  Larcher, and Raoul Rochette, (which appears to me at least the most
  consistent way of proceeding,) to the interpretative and
  half-incredulous processes applied by abler men&#8212;such as
  Niebuhr, or O. MÃ¼ller, or Dr Thirlwall&#8212;will not be displeased
  with my resolution to decline so insoluble a problem. No attested
  facts are now present to us&#8212;none were present to Herodotus and
  Thucydides even in their age, on which to build trustworthy
  affirmations respecting the anti-Hellenic Pelasgians; and where such
  is the case we may without impropriety apply the remark of Herodotus
  respecting one of the theories which he had heard for explaining the
  inundation of the Nile by a supposed connexion with the
  ocean&#8212;that the man who carries up his story into the invisible
  world, passes out of the range of criticism.&quot;<a name=
  "FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class=
  "fnanchor">[2]</a> And he adds the following pithy
  note:&#8212;&quot;Niebuhr puts together all the mythical and
  genealogical traces, many of them in the highest degree vague and
  equivocal, of the existence of Pelasgi in various localities; and
  then, summing up their cumulative effect, asserts, &#39;not as an
  hypothesis, but with full historical conviction, that there was a
  time when the Pelasgians, perhaps the most extended people in all
  Europe, were spread from the Po and the Arno to the Rhyndakus,&#39;
  (near Cyzicus,) with only an interruption in Thrace. What is perhaps
  the most remarkable of all, is the contrast between his feeling of
  disgust, despair, and aversion to the subject when he begins the
  inquiry:&#8212;&#39;the name Pelasgi,&#39; he says, &#39;is odious to
  the historian, who hates the spurious philology out of which the
  pretences to knowledge on the subject of such extinct people
  arise;&#39; and the full confidence and satisfaction with which he
  concludes it.&quot;</p>

  <p>Amongst these legends which Mr Grote thus relates for the simple
  purpose of showing what filled the minds of the Greek people when we
  first become historically acquainted with them, is one conspicuous
  above all others, and to which most men still cling tenaciously,
  finding it impossible to resign <i>all</i> of it to the region of
  fable&#8212;we mean &quot;the divine tale of Troy.&quot; Many who
  relinquish without effort the Argonautic expedition, and as an
  historical problem are glad to be rid of it,&#8212;who resign all
  attempt to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg
  137]</a></span> extract a prosaic truth out of the exploits of
  Theseus or the labours of Hercules, and who smile at mention of the
  race of Amazons&#8212;a race so well accredited in ancient times that
  neither the sceptical Arrian nor Julius CÃ¦sar himself ventured to
  doubt of their existence&#8212;would yet shrink from surrendering the
  tale of Troy, with all its military details, and all its hosts, and
  all its kings and chieftains, entirely to the domain of fiction.
  What! No part of it true?&#8212;no Agamemnon?&#8212;no
  Ulysses?&#8212;no Troy taken?&#8212;no battles on that plain where
  the traveller still traces the position of the hostile forces?
  &quot;Those old kings,&quot; they might exclaim in the language of
  Milton, when writing in his history of that fabulous line of English
  monarchs which sprang from Brute the Trojan&#8212;in his time still
  lingering in men&#39;s faith, now suffered to sleep unvexed by the
  keenest historical research,&#8212;&quot;Those old and inborn kings,
  never any to have been real persons, or done in their lives at least
  some part of what so long hath been remembered&#8212;<i>it cannot be
  thought</i>, without too strict incredulity.&quot;<a name=
  "FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class=
  "fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

  <p>Nevertheless the whole narrative, were it not for the familiarity
  we early acquire with the persons and exploits of this famous legend,
  would be seen at once to have all the characteristics of poetic
  fiction. And it is curious to trace, with our author, how, after
  having long stood its ground as veritable history amongst the people
  of Greece, it sustained attack after attack, first from ancient then
  from modern criticism, and has been gradually denuded of all its
  glorious circumstance, till now, even for those who are most willing
  to believe, there remains the driest, scantiest residue imaginable of
  what may be pronounced to be probable fact. Herodotus, with all his
  veneration for Homer, could not assent to attribute the Trojan war to
  the cause popularly assigned: he seems to have been of the opinion of
  our Payne Knight, that the Greeks and Trojans could not have been so
  mad as to incur so dire calamities &quot;for one little woman.&quot;
  We confess that, for ourselves, this is not the part of the story
  which would have first staggered us. The immediate cause may be very
  trifling that brings two angry rivals into conflict, and, the war
  once commenced, they fight on for victory; the first object of the
  strife is forgotten in the strife itself, and each opponent thinks
  only how to destroy his enemy. Herodotus, however, had heard another
  account from the priests of Egypt, which made him still more disposed
  to dispute the popular tradition. According to this account, Helen
  was in fact detained in Egypt during the whole term of the siege.
  Paris, it seems, in sailing from Sparta, had been driven thither by a
  storm; and the king of Egypt, hearing of the wrong he had committed
  towards Menelaus, had sent him out of the country, and detained Helen
  till her lawful husband should appear to claim her. The misfortune
  was, that when the Greeks before Troy demanded Helen, and were told
  that she neither was, nor had been in the town, they would not
  believe the story, but continued to thunder at the gates. &quot;For
  if Helen had really been in Troy,&quot; says Herodotus, &quot;she
  would certainly have been given up, even if she had been mistress of
  Priam himself instead of Paris: the Trojan king, with all his family
  and all his subjects, would never knowingly have incurred utter and
  irretrievable destruction for the purpose of retaining her; their
  misfortune was, that while they did not possess, and therefore could
  not restore her, they yet found it impossible to convince the Greeks
  that such was the fact.&quot;</p>

  <p>Pausanias, a reasoning man, starts at the Trojan horse: he
  converts it into a battering-ram, as he cannot believe the Trojans to
  have been deceived by so childish a trick.</p>

  <p>Thucydides, a man who knew something of campaigning, is astonished
  at the length of the siege; and perhaps his patriotism was put a
  little to the blush at the idea that the assembled forces of Greece
  should be occupied ten years before a town of very inconsiderable
  magnitude; for <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id=
  "Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span> no town of Ilium, we may remark in
  passing, ever existed that could present a worthy object of attack to
  so great a power, or was at all commensurate with the vast enterprise
  said to have been directed against it. He concluded, therefore,
  without hesitation, &quot;that the Greeks were less numerous than the
  poets have represented, and that being, moreover, very poor, they
  were unable to procure adequate and constant provisions: hence they
  were compelled to disperse their army, and to employ a part of it in
  cultivating the Chersonese, and a part in marauding expeditions over
  the neighbourhood. Could the whole army have been employed against
  Troy at once, the siege would have been much more speedily and easily
  concluded.&quot; As Mr Grote justly observes, the critical historian
  might, with equal authority, have proceeded by a shorter method, and
  at once abridged the length of the siege.</p>

  <p>&quot;Though literally believed,&quot; he continues, speaking of
  the Trojan war, &quot;though reverentially cherished, and numbered
  among the gigantic phenomena of the past, by the Grecian public, it
  is in the eyes of modern inquiry essentially a legend, and nothing
  more. If we are asked if it be not a legend embodying portions of
  historical matter, and raised upon a basis of truth,&#8212;whether
  there may not really have occurred at the foot of the hill of Ilium a
  war purely human and political, without gods, without heroes, without
  Helen, without Amazons, without Ethiopians under the beautiful son of
  Eos, without the wooden horse, without the characteristic and
  expressive features of the old epical war&#8212;like the mutilated
  trunk of DeÃ¯phobus in the under-world&#8212;if we are asked whether
  there was not really some such historical Trojan war as this, our
  answer must be, that as the possibility of it cannot be denied, so
  neither can the reality of it be affirmed. We possess nothing but the
  ancient epic itself, without any independent evidence: had it been an
  age of records, indeed, the Homeric epic, in its exquisite and
  unsuspecting simplicity, would probably never have come into
  existence. Whoever, therefore, ventures to dissect Homer, Arctinus,
  and Lesches, and to pick out certain portions as matters of fact,
  while he sets aside the rest as fiction, must do so in full reliance
  on his own powers of historical divination, without any means either
  of proving or verifying his conclusions.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_4_4"
  id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class=
  "fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

  <p>Take Helen from Troy, and Achilles son of Thetis from the camp,
  and say there was <i>a</i> siege&#8212;this is a result which few,
  perhaps, would care to contend about. It is the only result for which
  Dr Thirlwall contends, who on this subject approximates as nearly as
  possible to the opinion of Mr Grote. That there was a siege, however,
  Dr Thirlwall maintains with considerable pertinacity; but it happens,
  curiously enough, that his argument precisely supplies the last link
  that was wanting to complete the sceptical view of the subject. Most
  persons, we apprehend, are disposed to adhere to the belief that some
  famous siege must have taken place, or why should the poet&#39;s
  imagination take this direction?&#8212;why should he cluster his
  heroes and his exploits round the walls of Troy? Now, the effect of
  Dr Thirlwall&#39;s line of argument is to show how the poet&#39;s
  imagination was likely to take this direction, and yet there have
  been no siege of Troy, none at least by Agamemnon and his allies,
  none at the epoch which Homer assigns to it.</p>

  <p>&quot;We conceive it necessary,&quot; says Dr Thirlwall, &quot;to
  admit the reality of the Trojan war as a general fact; but beyond
  this we scarcely venture to proceed a single step.&quot;<a name=
  "FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class=
  "fnanchor">[5]</a> He finds it impossible to adopt the poetical story
  of its origin, partly from its inherent improbability, and partly
  &quot;because we are convinced that Helen is a merely mythological
  person. It would be sufficient,&quot; he says, &quot;to raise a
  strong suspicion of her fabulous nature to observe that she is
  classed by Herodotus with Io, and Europa, and Medea&#8212;all of them
  persons who, on distinct grounds, must clearly be referred to the
  domain of mythology. This suspicion is confirmed by all the
  particulars of her legend; by her <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span> birth, (the daughter of
  Jupiter, according to Homer;) by her relation to the divine Twins,
  whose worship seems to have been one of the most ancient forms of
  religion in Peloponnesus, and especially in Laconia; and by the
  divine honours paid to her in Laconia and elsewhere.&quot;</p>

  <p>Compelled to reject the cause of the war assigned by Homer, and
  finding Helen a merely mythological person, &quot;we are
  driven,&quot; he continues, &quot;to conjecture to discover the true
  cause; yet not so as to be wholly without traces to direct us.&quot;
  He then refers to the legend which, numbering Hercules among the
  Argonauts, supposes him, on the voyage, to have rendered a service to
  the Trojan king Laomedon, who afterwards defrauded him of his
  stipulated recompense. Whereupon Hercules, coming with some seven
  ships, is said to have taken and sacked Troy; an event which is
  alluded to and recognised by Homer. &quot;And thus we see,&quot; adds
  the author, &quot;Troy already provoking the enmity or tempting the
  cupidity of the Greeks, in the generation before the celebrated war;
  and it may be easily conceived that if its power and opulence revived
  after this blow, it might again excite the same feelings.&quot;</p>

  <p>Very easily conceived, but not rendered a jot more easy by aid of
  this legend of Hercules. The story of him of the Twelve Labours, who
  had been cheated of the divine mares for which he had bargained, and
  had mere earthly mares given to him, and who therefore, in revenge,
  had sacked the town of Troy, is, in the first place, so interpreted
  as to show &quot;that the opulence of that city had in former times
  tempted the cupidity of the Greeks;&quot; and then this
  interpretation is made a ground for supposing that a similar motive
  had led to the expedition of Agamemnon and his chiefs. As well,
  surely, have said at once of the second war, what is said of the
  first, that it was an ordinary case of plunder and violence. It is
  hard to understand how the earlier legend can assist in giving an
  historical character to the later.</p>

  <p>But the elder legend may assist in explaining how a siege of Troy
  became the great subject of the Homeric poems; and thus, whatever
  there was of actual siege may be carried altogether into that remote
  anterior epoch which is shadowed forth, if you will, under the
  exploits of Hercules. For with that charming candour by which he
  often contrives to neutralise the errors of his conjectural method of
  writing history, Dr Thirlwall himself adds:&#8212;&quot;This
  expedition of Hercules may indeed suggest a doubt <i>whether it was
  not an earlier and simpler form of the same tradition, which grew at
  length into the argument of the Iliad</i>; for there is a striking
  resemblance between the two wars, not only in the events, but in the
  principal actors. As the prominent figures in the second siege are
  Agamemnon and Achilles, who represent the royal house of MycenÃ¦, and
  that of the Ã†acids; so in the first the Argive Hercules is
  accompanied by the Ã†acid Telamon; and even the quarrel and
  reconciliation of the allied chiefs are features common to both
  traditions.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id=
  "FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class=
  "fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

  <p>The disquisition on the legend of Troy naturally leads the
  historian, and will naturally suggest to our own readers, the mooted
  question of the authorship of the Homeric poems. Some of them be
  happy to learn that the opinion of Mr Grote is not <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span> of so
  sceptical a nature as they may have been prepared to expect. The
  Wolfian hypothesis he by no means adopts&#8212;namely, that before
  the time of Pisistratus, there was no such thing in existence as an
  extended and entire epic, but that the two great epics we now possess
  were then constructed by stringing together a number of detached
  poems, the separate chants of the old Greek bards or rhapsodists. Mr
  Grote sees in the <i>Odyssey</i> all the marks of unity of design,
  and of what he rather quaintly calls &quot;single-headed
  authorship.&quot; With regard to the <i>Iliad</i>, he admits that
  there is not the same stringent evidence of an original plan
  according to which the whole poem has been written, and he detects
  here the signs of interpolation and addition. According to his view,
  there is in the poem, as we possess it, an original whole, which he
  calls the Achilleis, to which additions have been made from other
  sources, converting the Achilleis into an Iliad. But our readers
  would prefer to have the words themselves of the author; and the
  following passage will present them with a very intelligent view of
  this famous controversy:&#8212;</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>&quot;That the <i>Iliad</i> is not so essentially one piece as
    the <i>Odyssey</i>, every man agrees. It includes a much greater
    multiplicity of events, and what is yet more important, a greater
    multiplicity of prominent personages: the very indefinite title
    which it bears, as contrasted with the speciality of the name
    <i>Odyssey</i>, marks the difference at once. The parts stand out
    more conspicuously from the whole, and admit more readily of being
    felt and appreciated in detached recitation. We may also add, that
    it is of more unequal execution than the <i>Odyssey-</i>-often
    rising to a far higher pitch of grandeur, but also occasionally
    tamer: the story does not move on continually; incidents occur
    without plausible motive, nor can we shut our eyes to evidences of
    incoherence and contradiction.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>&quot;To a certain extent, the <i>Iliad</i> is open to all these
    remarks, though Wolf and W. MÃ¼ller, and above all, Lachmann,
    exaggerate the case in degree. And from hence has been deduced the
    hypothesis which treats the part in their original state as
    separate integers, independent of, and unconnected with each other,
    and forced into unity only by the afterthought of a subsequent age;
    or sometimes not even themselves as integers, but as aggregates
    grouped together out of fragments still smaller&#8212;short epics
    formed by the coalescence of still shorter songs. Now there is some
    plausibility in these reasonings, so long as the
    <i>discrepancies</i> are looked upon as the whole of the case. But
    in point of fact they are not the whole of the case; for it is not
    less true that there are large portions of the <i>Iliad</i>, which
    present positive and undeniable evidences of <i>coherence</i>, as
    antecedent and consequent, though we are occasionally perplexed by
    inconsistencies of detail. To deal with these latter, is a portion
    of the duties of a critic; but he is not to treat the <i>Iliad</i>
    as if inconsistency prevailed every where throughout its parts; for
    coherence of parts&#8212;symmetrical antecedence and
    consequence&#8212;is discernible throughout the larger half of the
    poem.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>&quot;Now the Wolfian theory explains the gaps and
    contradictions throughout the narrative, but it explains nothing
    else. If (as Lachmann thinks) the <i>Iliad</i> originally consisted
    of sixteen songs or little substantive epics, not only composed by
    different authors, but by each without any view to conjunction with
    the rest&#8212;we have then no right to expect any intrinsic
    continuity between them; and all that continuity which we now find
    must be of extraneous origin. Where are we to look for the origin?
    Lachmann follows Wolf in ascribing the whole constructive process
    to Peisistratus and his associates, at the period when the creative
    epical faculty is admitted to have died out. But upon this
    supposition, Peisistratus (or his associate) must have done much
    more than omit, transpose, and interpolate, here and there; he must
    have gone far to re-write the whole poem. A great poet might have
    re-cast pre-existing separate songs into one comprehensive whole,
    but no mere arrangers or compilers would be competent to do so; and
    we are thus left without any means of accounting for that degree of
    continuity and consistency which runs through so large a portion of
    the <i>Iliad</i>, though not through the whole. The idea that the
    poem as we read it grew out of atoms, not originally designed for
    the places which they now occupy, involves us in new and
    inextricable difficulties when we seek to elucidate either the mode
    of coalescence or the degree of existing unity.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>&quot;Admitting, then, premeditated adaptation of parts to a
    certain extent as essential to the <i>Iliad</i>, we may yet inquire
    whether it was produced all at once or gradually
    enlarged&#8212;whether by one author or by several; and, if the
    parts be of different age, which <span class='pagenum'><a name=
    "Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span> is the primitive
    kernel, and which are the additions?</p>
  </div>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>&quot;Welcker, Lange, and Nitzeh, treat the Homeric poems as
    representing a second step in advance in the progress of popular
    poetry: First comes the age of short narrative songs; next, when
    these have become numerous, there arise constructive minds who
    re-cast and blend together many of them into a larger aggregate,
    conceived upon some scheme of their own. The age of the epos is
    followed by that of the epopee: short spontaneous effusions prepare
    the way, and furnish materials for the architectonic genius of the
    poet. It is farther presumed by the above-mentioned authors that
    the pre-Homeric epic included a great abundance of such smaller
    songs&#8212;a fact which admits of no proof, but which seems
    countenanced by some passages in Homer, and is in itself no way
    improbable. But the transition from such songs, assuming them to be
    ever so numerous, to a combined and continuous poem, forms an epoch
    in the intellectual history of a nation, implying mental qualities
    of a higher order than those upon which the songs themselves
    depend. Nor is it at all to be imagined that the materials pass
    unaltered from their first state of combination: they must of
    necessity be re-cast, and undergo an adapting process, in which the
    genius of the organising poet consists; and we cannot hope, by
    simply knowing them as they exist in the second stage, ever to
    divine how they stood in the first. Such, in my judgment, is the
    right conception of the Homeric epoch&#8212;an organising poetical
    mind, still preserving that freshness of observation and vivacity
    of details which constitutes the charm of the ballad.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>&quot;Nothing is gained by studying the Iliad as a congeries of
    fragments once independent of each other: no portion of the poem
    can be shown to have ever been so, and the supposition introduces
    difficulties greater than those which it removes. But it is not
    necessary to affirm that the whole poem, as we now read it,
    belonged to the original and preconceived plan. In this respect the
    <i>Iliad</i> produces upon my mind an impression totally different
    from the <i>Odyssey.</i> In the latter poem the characters and
    incidents are fewer; the whole plot appears of one projection, from
    the beginning down to the death of the suitors: none of the parts
    look as if they had been composed separately, and inserted by way
    of addition into a pre-existing smaller poem. But the <i>Iliad</i>,
    on the contrary, presents the appearance of a house built upon a
    plan comparatively narrow, and subsequently enlarged by successive
    additions. The first book, together with the eighth, and the books
    from the eleventh to the twenty-second inclusive, seem to form the
    primary organisation of the poem, then properly an
    <i>AchilleÃ¯s</i>: the twenty-third and twenty-fourth books are
    additions at the tail of this primitive poem, which still leave it
    nothing more than an enlarged <i>AchilleÃ¯s</i>: but the books from
    the second to the seventh inclusive, together with the tenth, are
    of a wider and more comprehensive character, and convert the poem
    from an <i>AchilleÃ¯s</i> into an <i>Iliad</i>. The primitive
    frontispiece, inscribed with the anger of Achilles and its direct
    consequences, yet remains, after it has ceased to be co-extensive
    with the poems. The parts added, however, are not necessarily
    inferior in merit to the original poem: so far is this from being
    the case, that amongst them are comprehended some of the noblest
    efforts of the Grecian epic.&quot;&#8212;(Vol. ii. p. 230.)</p>
  </div>

  <p>To many persons the undisputed fact that the Homeric poems were
  composed to be recited, not read, has appeared a convincing proof
  that they could not have originally assumed the form in which they
  are known to us. For setting aside the difficulty of preserving by
  the aid only of memory, and the still greater difficulty of
  <i>composing</i> a long poem without help of the manuscript, to keep
  <i>secure</i> the part already completed, what motive, it has been
  said, could induce the poet to undertake so great and so superfluous
  a labour? Why indite a poem so much longer than could be recited on
  any one occasion, and which, <i>as a whole</i>, could never be
  appreciated? But we would suggest that it is not necessary to suppose
  that the poet commenced his labours with the project in view of
  writing a long epic, in order to believe that we possess these two
  great poems very nearly in the original form in which they were
  composed. If it were the task of the poet or poets to supply a number
  of songs on the adventures of a popular hero, or the achievements of
  some famous war, such number of songs <i>must</i> assume a certain
  consecutive order, the one will necessarily grow out of the other.
  Let any one reflect for a moment how the work of composition
  proceeds, and he will perceive that it would be impossible for a poet
  to take any one such subject as the siege of Troy, or <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span> the
  return of Ulysses, as the theme for a number of separate poems, and
  not find that he was writing, with more or less continuity, one long
  entire poem. This continuity would be improved and especially
  attended to, when a certain <i>order</i> came to be preserved (as we
  know it was) in the recitation of the several poems. We have no
  difficulty, therefore, in believing that, in the time of Pisistratus,
  the <i>editors</i> of Homer might have had very little to do to give
  them that degree of completeness and unity which they at present
  display. A number of consecutive songs upon the same subject would
  naturally grow into an epic.</p>

  <p>No decisive argument, we submit, can be drawn from the absence or
  limited application of the art of writing at the era assigned for the
  composition of these poems. There is nothing left for us but to
  examine the poems themselves, to determine what degree of unity of
  plan or of authorship may be attributed to them. Unfortunately the
  critical perception of scholars, equally eminent, leads to such
  different results, that the controversy appears to be hopeless. Where
  one sees with the utmost distinctness the difference of workmanship,
  another sees with equal clearness the traces of the same genius and
  manner. And in controversies of this nature, there is unhappily a
  most perverse combination of the strongest conviction with an utter
  impotence to force that conviction upon another. Between these two, a
  man is generally driven into a passion; and thus we often find a
  bitter, acrid mood infused into literary discussions, which, lying as
  they do apart from the selfish and conflicting interests of men,
  would seem to be the theatre for no such display. The controversy
  rages still in Germany, and, it seems, with considerable heat.
  Lachmann, after dissecting a certain portion of the Iliad into four
  songs, &quot;in the highest degree different in their spirit,&quot;
  tells us that whoever thinks the difference of spirit
  inconsiderable&#8212;whoever does not feel it at once when pointed
  out&#8212;whoever can believe that the parts as they stand now belong
  to one artistically constructed epos, &quot;will do well not to
  trouble himself any more either with my criticisms, or with epic
  poetry, because he is too weak to understand any thing about
  it&#8212;(&quot;<i>weil er zu schwach ist etwas darin zu
  verstehen.</i>&quot;) On the contrary, Ulrici, after having shown (or
  tried to show) that the composition of Homer satisfies perfectly, in
  the main, all the exigencies of an artistic epic, adds, that this
  will make itself at once evident to all those who have any sense of
  artistical symmetry, but that to those to whom that sense is wanting,
  no conclusive demonstration call be given. He warns the latter,
  however, they are not to deny the existence of that which their
  short-sighted vision cannot distinguish, for every thing cannot be
  made clear to children, which the mature man sees through at a
  glance! Mr Grote, from whom we quote these instances, adds that he
  has the misfortune to dissent both from Lachmann and Ulrici; for to
  him it appears a mistake to put (as Ulrici and others have done) the
  Iliad and the Odyssey on the same footing. The sort of compromise
  which Mr Grote offers seems very fair; but, for our part, we beg
  <i>to reserve the point</i>; we will not commit ourselves on so
  delicate a subject, by a hasty assent. But we promise to read our
  Homer again with an especial regard to these boundaries he has
  pointed out between the <i>AchilleÃ¯s</i> and the <i>Iliad</i>.</p>

  <p>Who Homer himself may have been, and if the blind bard ever
  existed, is a question, of course, very different from the degree of
  unity to be traced in the two great poems which have descended to us
  under his name. On this subject Mr Grote gives us an hypothesis
  which, as far as we are aware, is new and original. It has not,
  however, won our conviction&#8212;and we had intended to offer some
  objections against it. But we have already dwelt so long on this
  legendary period, that unless we break from it at once, we shall have
  no space left to give any idea whatever of the manner in which Mr
  Grote treats the more historical periods of his history. We must be
  allowed, therefore, to make a bold and abrupt transition; and, as
  every one in a history of Greece turns his eye first toward Athens,
  we shall, at one single bound, light upon the city of Minerva as she
  appeared in the age of Solon and Pisistratus. <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

  <p>A fidelity to the spirit of the epoch upon which he is engaged, as
  well as to the text of his authorities, we have already remarked, is
  a distinguishing merit of Mr Grote. Of this, his chapters upon the
  age of Solon might be cited as an illustration. We are persuaded that
  a reader of many a history of Greece, unless himself observant, and
  on the watch to detect, as he passes, the signs of the times, might
  proceed from the age of Pisistratus to that of Pericles, and not be
  made aware how very great the advancement, during that period, of the
  intellectual condition of the people of Athens. He has been in Athens
  all the time, but how very different have the Athenians become! And
  unless he were under the guidance of some more powerful thinker than
  ordinarily wields the pen of history, he might be little aware of the
  change. Mr Grote points it out with great distinctness.</p>

  <p>At the first of these epochs, it is but a barbarous people, with
  qualities which bode something better&#8212;that bear the name of
  Athenians. Amongst the laws of Solon, is one which forbids &quot;the
  sale of daughters or sisters into slavery by fathers or
  brothers!&quot; A law is enacted against the exportation of all
  produce of the soil of Attica except olive oil, and to enforce this
  commercial or non-commercial regulation, &quot;the archon was bound,
  on pain of forfeiting a hundred drachms, to pronounce solemn curses
  against every offender!&quot; The superstitious or religious
  feelings, if we must honour them by the latter name, are rude and
  violent in the extreme&#8212;give rise to frenzy amongst the
  people,&#8212;the women especially,&#8212;and call for or admit of
  human sacrifice. <i>Both</i> the artifices by which Pisistratus on
  two several occasions succeeded in obtaining the tyranny, indicate a
  people in the very first stages of civilisation. But what shall be
  said of the second or grosser of these artifices?&#8212;his entrance
  into Athens in a chariot with a tall damsel by his side, personating
  Minerva, <i>visibly</i> under the protection of the goddess.</p>

  <p>It is worth observing, that the same class of historians who are
  given to extract with an unauthorised boldness a prosaic fact from a
  poetic legend, are also the slowest and most reluctant in
  understanding the more startling facts which meet them on historic
  ground, in their simple and full significance. They are bold before
  the fable, they are timid before the fact. Nor is this surprising. In
  both cases they are on the search for incidents analogous to those
  which the ordinary course of life or of history has made familiar to
  their imagination. They see these with an exuberant faith where they
  do not exist, and will see nothing <i>but</i> these when something of
  a far different nature is actually put before them. Mr Grote, who
  refused to tread at all on the insecure ground of the legend, meets
  this narrative of the second entry of Pisistratus into Athens upon
  the level ground of history, and sees it in its simple form, and sees
  the people in it. Dr Thirlwall, on the contrary, who would read the
  history of a people&#39;s wars and emigrations in the fabulous
  exploits of fabulous persons, is staggered at the
  story&#8212;converts it all into a holiday pageant! It was some show
  or procession, and all the world knew as well as Pisistratus that it
  was the damsel PhyÃª, and not Minerva, who stood in the chariot.</p>

  <p>&quot;This story would indeed be singular,&quot; writes Dr
  Thirlwall, &quot;if we consider the expedient in the light of a
  stratagem, on which the confederates relied for overcoming the
  resistance which they might otherwise have expected from their
  adversaries. But it seems quite as possible that the pageant was only
  designed to add extraordinary solemnity to the entrance of
  Pisistratus, and to suggest the reflection that it was by the special
  favour of Heaven he had been so unexpectedly
  restored.&quot;&#8212;(Vol. ii. p. 67.)</p>

  <p>If this story stood alone in spirit and character, and there were
  no other contemporary events to occasion us the same kind of
  surprise, some such interpretation might not be unreasonable. But
  other facts which the historian himself relates with their unabated
  and literal significance, testify equally to the gross apprehension
  of the Athenian people at this epoch. What shall we say, of the visit
  of Epimenides to purify the city? The guilt, it seems, of sacrilege
  had, some time past, been incurred by Megacles and his associates,
  who had put to death certain of their enemies within <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span> the
  precincts of the temple of Minerva, whither they had fled for refuge.
  Megacles might have starved them there, but was scrupulous to bring
  this defilement upon the temple. He therefore promised to spare their
  lives if they would quit the sanctuary. Upon this they came forth,
  holding however, as an additional safeguard, a rope in their hands
  which was fastened to the statue of Minerva. Better not have trusted
  to the rope, for it broke. Megacles, seeing this, pronounced aloud
  that the goddess had evidently withdrawn her protection, and ordered
  them to be put to death. For this sacrilege&#8212;not for the
  promise-breaking or bloodshed&#8212;a curse hung over the city.
  Superstitious terrors haunted the inhabitants; the scarcity, the
  sickness, every evil that afflicted them, was attributed to this
  cause; and the women especially, gave themselves up to frantic
  demonstrations of fear and piety.</p>

  <p>There was a man of Crete, born of a nymph, fed by the nymphs, if
  indeed he was fed at all, for no one saw him eat. In his youth, this
  marvellous Cretan had been sent by his father to bring home some
  stray sheep, and turning aside into a cave for shelter from the
  noontide heat, had fallen asleep. He slept on for fifty years. Either
  supernatural knowledge comes in sleep, or Epimenides invented this
  fable to stop all inquiries as to where, or how, he had passed the
  early period of his life. He attained the age of one hundred and
  fifty-four&#8212;some say three hundred years.</p>

  <p>This remarkable person, supposed to know by what means the anger
  of the gods might be propitiated, was called to Athens. What means he
  devised for this purpose may easily be conjectured. After the
  performance of certain religious ceremonies, the foundation of a new
  temple, and the sacrifice of a human victim, the Athenians were
  restored to their usual tranquillity.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    &quot;The religious mission of Epimenides to Athens,&quot; observes
    Mr Grote, &quot;and its efficacious as well as healing influence on
    the public mind, deserve notice as characteristics of the age in
    which they occurred. If we transport ourselves two centuries
    forward to the Peloponnesian war, when rational influences and
    positive habits of thought had acquired a durable hold upon the
    superior minds, and when practical discussion on political and
    judicial matters were familiar to every Athenian citizen, no such
    uncontrollable religious misery could well have subdued the entire
    public; and if it had, no living man could have drawn to himself
    such universal veneration as to be capable of effecting a cure.
    Plato, admitting the real healing influence of rites and
    ceremonies, fully believed in Epimenides as an inspired prophet
    during the past, but towards those who preferred claims to
    supernatural power in his own day, he was not so easy of faith: he,
    as well as Euripides and Theophrastus, treated with indifference,
    and even with contempt, the OrpheotelestÃ¦ of the later times, who
    advertised themselves as possessing the same patent knowledge of
    ceremonial rites, and the same means of guiding the will of the
    gods, as Epimenides had wielded before them.... Had Epimenides
    himself come to Athens in those days, his visit would probably have
    been as much inoperative to all public purposes as a repetition of
    the stratagem of PhyÃª, clothed and equipped as the goddess Athena,
    which had succeeded so completely in the days of
    Peisistratus&#8212;a stratagem which even Herodotus treats as
    incredibly absurd, although a century before his time both the city
    of Athens and the Demas of Attica had obeyed, as a divine mandate,
    the orders of this magnificent and stately woman to restore
    Peisistratus.&quot;&#8212;(Vol. iii. p. 116.)
  </div>

  <p>There is nothing to which we are more averse than the converting
  ancient history into a field for the discussion of modern <i>party
  politics</i>. We are fully persuaded that the most thorough English
  Conservative may admire the Athenian republic; so far at least admire
  as to admit that it is impossible to conceive how, under any other
  form of government, the peculiar glories of Athens could have shone
  forth. And, indeed, an Athenian democracy differs so entirely from
  any political institution which the world sees at present, or will
  ever see again, that to carry the strife of our politics back into
  those times, in other than a quite general manner, is as futile as it
  is tasteless and vexatious. After this avowal, we shall not be
  thought disposed to enter into any needless cavil, upon this topic,
  with Mr Grote; we shall not, certainly, be upon the watch to detect
  the too liberal politician in the historian <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>of
  Greece. An interest in the working of popular institutions is a
  qualification the more for his task; and the historian himself must
  have felt that it was no mean advantage he had acquired by having
  taken his seat in our house of parliament, and mingled personally in
  the affairs of a popular government. What the future volumes of the
  history may disclose, we will not venture to prognosticate; but,
  hitherto, we have met with nothing which deserves the opprobrium of
  being attributed to party spirit. There is a certain <i>tone</i> in
  some of his political observations which, as may be supposed, we
  should not altogether adopt; but many of them are excellent and
  instructive. Nothing could be better than the following remarks on
  the necessity of a &quot;constitutional morality.&quot; He is
  speaking of the reforms of Cleisthenes.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    &quot;It was necessary to create in the multitude, and through them
    to force upon the leading ambitious men, that rare and difficult
    sentiment which we may term a constitutional morality,&#8212;a
    paramount reverence for the forms of the constitution, enforcing
    obedience to the authorities acting under and within those forms,
    yet combined with the habit of open speech, of action, subject only
    to definite legal control, and unrestrained censure of those very
    authorities as to all their public acts,&#8212;combined, too, with
    the perfect confidence in the bosom of every citizen, amidst the
    bitterness of party contest, that the forms of the constitution
    will not be less sacred in the eyes of his opponents than in his
    own. This co-existence of freedom and self-imposed
    restraint&#8212;of obedience to authority with unmeasured censure
    of the persons exercising it&#8212;may be found in the aristocracy
    of England, (since about 1688,) as well as in the democracy of the
    American United States; and, because we are familiar with it, we
    are apt to suppose it a natural sentiment; though there seem to be
    few sentiments more difficult to establish and diffuse among a
    community, judging by the experience of history. We may see how
    imperfectly it exists, at this day, in the Swiss cantons; and the
    many violences of the French Revolution illustrate, amongst various
    other lessons, the fatal effects arising from its absence, even
    among a people high in the scale of intelligence. Yet the diffusion
    of such constitutional morality, not merely among the majority of
    any community, but throughout the whole, is the indispensable
    condition of a government at once free and peaceable; since even
    any powerful and obstinate minority may render the working of free
    institutions impracticable, without being strong enough to conquer
    ascendency for themselves.&quot;&#8212;Vol. iv. p. 205.
  </div>

  <p>Then follow, close on the extract we have just made, some
  observations upon the famous law of Ostracism, which are well
  deserving of attention, and which we would willingly quote did our
  space allow of it. Perhaps it would be difficult, in following out
  the several applications of this law, to show that it had exactly the
  beneficial operation which&#8212;arguing on the theory of the
  institution,&#8212;is here assigned to it. But, at the very lowest,
  this much may be said of the law of Ostracism, that it gives to the
  stronger of two factions a means of deciding the contest without
  appeal to force, before the contest rose to its maximum of
  bitterness, and without necessity or excuse for those wholesale
  banishments which afflicted the republics of Italy. If such an
  institution had existed in the Florentine republic, we should not
  have heard of those cruel banishments that Guelph and Ghibelline,
  Bianchi and Neri, inflicted upon each other; such banishments as
  that, for instance, in which its great poet Dante was involved.</p>

  <p>Of one remarkable event, characterising the working of the
  Athenian government, we do not assent to the view presented to us by
  Mr Grote. His last published volume brings down the affairs of Greece
  to the battle of Marathon and the death of Miltiades. In the sentence
  passed on the hero of Marathon, the operation of a popular government
  has been often disadvantageously traced; the Athenians have been
  accused of fickleness and ingratitude. Mr Grote repels the charge.
  With some observations upon this defence, which forms the conclusion
  of the fourth and last of the published volumes, we shall bring our
  own notice to a close.</p>

  <p><i>Ingratitude</i>, we readily admit, is not the proper word to be
  used on such an occasion. A citizen serves the state, and is
  honoured; if he commits a crime against the state he is not, on this
  account, to go unpunished. His previous services invest him with no
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg
  146]</a></span>privilege to break the laws, or act criminally. What
  man, capable of doing, a patriotic action, would wish for such a
  privilege, or dream of laying claim to it?</p>

  <p>Not gratitude or ingratitude&#8212;but justice or
  injustice&#8212;is the issue to be tried between Miltiades and the
  Athenian assembly. And although Mr Grote is supported, in some
  measure, by Dr Thirlwall in the judgment he gives on this
  transaction, we prefer to side here with the opinion expressed by the
  earlier historian, Mr Mitford: we view the sentence passed on
  Miltiades not as the triumph of law or justice, but of mere
  party-spirit, the triumph of a faction gained through the
  unreasonable anger of the people.</p>

  <p>Though the extract is rather long, we must, in justice, give the
  narrative of Mr Grote in his own language.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>&quot;His reputation (that of Miltiades) had been great before
    the battle (of Marathon), and after it the admiration and
    confidence of his countrymen knew no bounds; it appears indeed to
    have reached such a pitch, that his head was turned, and he lost
    both his patriotism and his prudence. He proposed to his countrymen
    to incur the cost of equipping an armament of seventy ships, with
    an adequate armed force, and to place it altogether at his
    discretion; giving them no intimation whither he intended to go,
    but merely assuring them that if they would follow him, he would
    conduct them to a land where gold was abundant, and thus enrich
    them. Such a promise, from the lips of the recent victor of
    Marathon, was sufficient, and the armament was granted; no man
    except Miltiades knowing what was its destination. He sailed
    immediately to the island of Paros, laid siege to the town, and
    sent in a herald to require from the inhabitants a contribution of
    one hundred talents, on pain of entire destruction. His pretence
    for this attack was, that the Parians had furnished a trireme to
    Datis for the Persian fleet at Marathon; but his real motive (so
    Herodotus assures us) was vindictive animosity against a Parian
    citizen named Lysagoras, who had exasperated the Persian general
    Hydarnes against him. The Parians amused him at first with
    evasions, until they had procured a little delay to repair the
    defective portions of their wall, after which they set him at
    defiance; and Miltiades in vain prosecuted hostilities against them
    for the space of twenty-six days: he ravaged the island, but his
    attacks made no impression on the town. Beginning to despair of
    success in his military operations, he entered into some
    negotiation (such at least was the tale of the Parians themselves,)
    with a Parian woman named TimÃ´, priestess or attendant in the
    temple of Demeter (Ceres) near the town-gates; this woman,
    promising to reveal to him a secret which would place Paros in his
    power, induced him to visit by night a temple to which no male
    person was admissible. He leaped the exterior fence and approached
    the sanctuary; but on coming near was seized with a panic terror
    and ran away, almost out of his senses; on leaping the same fence
    to get back, he strained or bruised his thigh badly, and became
    utterly disabled. In this melancholy state he was placed on
    ship-board; the siege being raised, and the whole armament
    returning to Athens.&quot;</p>
  </div>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>&quot;Vehement was the indignation both of the armament and the
    remaining Athenians against Miltiades on his return; and
    Zanthippus, father of the great Perikles, became the spokesman of
    this feeling. He impeached Miltiades before the popular judicature
    as having been guilty of deceiving the people, and so having
    deserved the penalty of death. The accused himself, disabled by his
    injured thigh, which even began to show symptoms of gangrene, was
    unable to stand or to say a word in his own defence; he lay on his
    couch before the assembled judges, while his friends made the best
    case they could in his behalf. Defence, it appears, there was none;
    all they could do was to appeal to his previous services; they
    reminded the people largely and emphatically of the inestimable
    exploit of Marathon, coming in addition to his previous conquest of
    Lemnos. The assembled dikasts or jurors showed their sense of these
    powerful appeals, by rejecting the proposition of his accuser to
    condemn him to death; but they imposed on him the penalty of fifty
    talents &#39;for his iniquity.&#39;&quot; (Vol. iv. p. 488.)</p>
  </div>

  <p>He died shortly after from his wound.</p>

  <p>On this narrative we must make one or two observations. The turn
  of expression which the writer has selected for conveying the meaning
  of the original Greek text of his authority, might lead us to imply
  that when the Athenians placed a force of seventy ships at the
  command of Miltiades they did not know on what <i>kind</i> of
  expedition he was about to employ them. &quot;He would conduct them
  to a land where gold was abundant, and thus enrich them.&quot; Surely
  no one had an idea that it was a <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>voyage of discovery, in
  search after some El Dorado that Miltiades was about to undertake.
  Every one in Athens knew that the fleet was to be directed against
  some of their neighbours: although, for very manifest
  reasons,&#8212;the advantage of taking their victim by surprise, and
  of leaving their general unfettered, to act according to
  circumstances,&#8212;the objects of attack were not revealed, and on
  this a perfect secrecy was allowed to be maintained. It should be
  also <i>added</i> to this account, that Zanthippes, father of
  Pericles, who made himself spokesman for the angry feeling of the
  Athenians, was also, as Dr Thirwall tells us, &quot;the son of
  Ariphron, the chief of the rival house of the Alcmaonids,&quot; who
  were little pleased with the sudden rise of Miltiades.</p>

  <p>From the same authority we may also learn, that &quot;Paros was at
  this time one of the most flourishing amongst the Cyclades.&quot;
  Miltiades directed the expedition against Paros from personal
  motives, from vindictive animosity against a Parian citizen; but
  Paros was rich, and could therefore pay a ransom&#8212;the very
  object of the expedition; and the pretext under which alone Athens
  could extort a ransom or a tribute from its neighbours, that they had
  assisted the Persians, or failed in bringing aid to the common cause
  against them, applied to Paros; it had furnished, or was accused of
  having furnished, a trireme to Datis. Whatever baseness Miltiades
  betrayed in using a public force for his own private revenge, there
  is nothing to make it appear that the selection of Paros for the
  object of his attack was not in perfect consistency with the real
  public purpose of the enterprise.</p>

  <p>What crime in all this had Miltiades committed against the
  <i>Athenians</i>? The injustice of the expedition they shared; for it
  would be childishness to suppose that they sent their general out
  with seventy ships, and had no idea that he would attack any one. The
  personal motives which led him to direct it against Paros, however
  mean and unworthy of him, are not shown to have been at variance with
  the professed objects of the expedition. Nor can any one doubt for a
  moment that if he had succeeded in extorting from the Parians, and
  others, a large sum of money, the Athenians would have welcomed him
  back with applause, as loud as the censure they bestowed on their
  defeated generals, who, instead of plunder, brought them back only
  the disgrace of having tried to plunder. There were those at hand
  ready to take advantage of the public irritation; they accused him,
  and obtained his condemnation. We are not claiming for Miltiades the
  praise of virtue; nor should we make any pathetic appeal in his
  behalf. He was not free from a moral delinquency; but, so far as the
  Athenians were concerned, his substantial offence was failure in his
  enterprise.</p>

  <p>That his friends urged no other defence but that of his previous
  services, is no proof that other grounds for acquittal were not
  present to their minds. They were pleading before angry and
  irresponsible judges, whom it, was their object to soothe and
  propitiate. Would the strain of inculpatory observations that we have
  been making, have answered their purpose? To tell an angry man that
  he is angry, because he is disappointed, is not the way to abate his
  passion. That Miltiades <i>had</i> disappointed them was certain;
  undoubtedly the best method of defence was to remind them of the
  great services that he had formerly rendered them. It was not the
  demands of judicial reason his advocates had to satisfy: they were
  pleading before judges whose feelings of the moment were to be the
  law of the moment.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    &quot;Thus closed the life of the conqueror of Marathon. The last
    act of it,&quot; continues Mr Grote, &quot;produces an impression
    so mournful, and even shocking&#8212;his descent from the pinnacle
    of glory, to defeat, mean tampering with a temple-servant, mortal
    bodily hurt, undefended ignominy, and death under a sentence of
    heavy fine, is so abrupt and unprepared&#8212;that readers, ancient
    and modern, have not been satisfied without finding some one to
    blame for it: we must except Herodotus, our original authority, who
    recounts the transaction without dropping a single hint of blame
    against any one. To speak ill of the people, as Machiavel has long
    ago observed, is a strain in which every one at all times, even
    under a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg
    148]</a></span> democratical government indulges with impunity and
    without provoking any opponent to reply; and in this case the hard
    fate of Miltiades has been imputed to the vices of the Athenians
    and their democracy&#8212;it has been cited in proof partly of
    their fickleness, partly of their ingratitude. But however such
    blame may serve to lighten the mental sadness arising from a series
    of painful facts, it will not be found justified if we apply to
    those facts a reasonable criticism.&quot;
  </div>

  <p>He thus vindicates the Athenians from the charge of
  <i>fickleness</i>, on the ground that it was not they, but Miltiades
  who had changed. The fugitive from Paros, and the victor of Marathon,
  were two very different persons. As any remarkable instance of
  fickleness we should certainly not be disposed to cite the case. The
  charge of <i>ingratitude</i>, we have admitted, is, presuming that he
  was guilty, entirely displaced. But when Mr Grote in his final
  summary says, &quot;The fate of Miltiades thus, so far from
  illustrating either the fickleness or the ingratitude of his
  countrymen, attests their just appreciation of deserts,&quot; we must
  indeed demur. No, no: this was not the triumph of justice over the
  finer sensibilities of our nature, as Mr Grote would seem to imply.
  On the fairest review we can give to the whole of the circumstances,
  we find on the sentence passed upon Miltiades a gross instance of
  that old notorious injustice which pronounces an enterprise
  meritorious or criminal according to its success. The enterprise was
  altogether a disgraceful affair. But the Athenians must be supposed
  cognisant of the nature of the expedition for which they fitted out
  their seventy ships:&#8212;<i>against them</i>, we repeat, the only
  substantial offence committed was his failure; nor can we doubt that
  his welcome back to Athens would have been quite different had there
  been a different issue to the adventure. Justice there was none;
  unless it be justice for three freebooters to pass sentence upon the
  fourth.</p>

  <p>Before concluding, we ought, perhaps, to take, some notice of the
  reform in our orthography of Greek words which Mr Grote is desirous
  of introducing, in order to assimilate the English to the Greek
  pronunciation. The principal of these is the substitution of
  <span class='smcap'>k</span> for <span class='smcap'>c</span>. Our
  own <span class='smcap'>k</span>, he justly observes, precisely
  coincides with the Greek <span class='smcap'>k</span>, while a
  <span class='smcap'>c</span> may be either <span class=
  'smcap'>k</span> or <span class='smcap'>s</span>. He writes Perikles,
  Alkibiades. To this approximation of the English pronunciation to the
  Greek we can see nothing to object. A reader of Greek finds it a mere
  annoyance, and sort of barbarism, to be obliged to pronounce the same
  name one way while reading Greek, and another when speaking or
  reading English; and to the English reader it must be immaterial
  which pronunciation he <i>finally</i> adopts. Meanwhile, it must be
  allowed that the first changing of an old familiar name is a
  disagreeable operation. We must leave the popular and the learned
  taste to arrange it how they can together. Mr Grote has wisely left
  some names&#8212;as Thucydides&#8212;in the old English form; in
  matters of this kind nothing is gained by too rigid a consistency. It
  is not improbable that his orthography will be adopted, in the first
  place, by the more learned writers, and will from their pages find
  its way into popular use. Mr Grote also, in speaking of the Greek
  deities, calls them by their Greek names, and not by the Latin
  equivalents&#8212;As <i>Zeus</i> for Jupiter&#8212;<i>Athene</i> for
  Minerva.</p>

      <i>Thirlwall</i>, vol. i. p. 154. On the subject of the Trojan
      war we quote the following passage from the same historian, as an
      instance of the extremely slender thread which a conjectural
      writer will think it worth his while to weave in amongst his
      arguments for the support of some dubious fact. &quot;One
      inevitable result,&quot; he says, &quot;of such an event as the
      Trojan war, must have been to diffuse amongst the Greeks a more
      general knowledge of the isles and coasts of the Ã†gean, and to
      leave a lively recollection of the beauty and fertility of the
      region in which their battles had been fought. This would direct
      the attention of future emigrants in search of new homes toward
      the same quarter; and the fact that the tide of migration really
      set in this direction first, when the state of Greece became
      unsettled, <i>may not unreasonably be thought to confirm the
      reality of the Trojan war</i>.&quot; (P. 250.) Little need, one
      would think, of a Trojan war to direct the tide of emigration to
      the opposite coasts of Asia Minor.</p>

  <h2><a name="BEN_NEVIS_AND_BEN_MUICH_DHUI" id=
  "BEN_NEVIS_AND_BEN_MUICH_DHUI"></a>BEN NEVIS AND BEN MUICH DHUI.</h2>

  <p>It was on a bright, hot day of July, which threw the first gleam
  of sunshine across a long tract of soaking, foggy, dreary, hopeless
  weather, that we ascended Ben Nevis. The act was unpremeditated. The
  wet and fog of weeks had entered into our soul; and we had resolved,
  in the spirit of indignant resignation, that we would <i>not</i>
  attempt the hill. Accordingly we were stalking lazily along General
  Wade&#39;s road: we had left Fort William, and thought there might be
  a probability of reaching Fort Augustus to dinner,&#8212;when we were
  not ungratefully surprised to see the clouds tucking themselves up
  the side of the mountain in a peculiar manner, which gives the
  experienced wanderer of the hills the firm assurance of a glorious
  day. Soon afterwards, the great mountain became visible from summit
  to base, and its round head and broad shoulders stood dark against
  the bright blue sky. A sagacious-looking old Highlander, who was
  passing, protested that the hill had never looked so hopeful during
  the whole summer: the temptation was irresistible, so we turned our
  steps towards the right, and commenced the ascent.</p>

  <p>It is one among the prevailing fallacies of the times, that to
  mount a Highland hill is a very difficult operation, and that one
  should hire a guide on the occasion. We lately witnessed a very
  distressing instance of the alarming prevalence of this notion, in a
  young Chancery barrister, fresh from Brick Court Temple, who asked us
  in a very solemn tone of voice, if we could recommend him to &quot;a
  steady guide to the top of Arthur Seat.&quot; When matters have come
  to such a crisis, it is time to speak out; and we are able, on the
  ground of long experience, to say, that if the proper day be chosen,
  and the right method adopted, the ascent of our grandest mountains is
  one of the simplest operations in all pedestrianism. True, if people
  take it in the way in which pigs run up all manner of streets, and go
  straight forward, looking neither to the right nor to the left, they
  will run their heads against nature&#39;s stone walls, which are at
  least as formidable as man&#39;s. But let any one study the disposal
  of the ground, calculating the gradients and summit levels as if he
  were a railway-engineer for the time being&#8212;let him observe
  where the moss lies deep, and precipices rise too steep to be
  scrambled over; and he will be very obtuse indeed, if he is not able
  to chalk out for himself precisely the best way to the top. It is a
  good general rule to keep by the side of a stream. That if you do so
  when you are at the top of a hill, you will somehow or other find
  your way to the bottom, is, we are convinced, a proposition as sound
  as Newton&#39;s theory of gravitation. But in the ascent, the stream
  is often far better than a human guide. It has no interest to lead
  you to the top of some episodical hill and down again, and to make
  you scramble over an occasional dangerous pass, to show you how
  impossible it is that you could have found the way yourself, and how
  fortunate you are in having secured the services of an intelligent
  and intrepid guide. On the contrary, as long as you keep by the side
  of the stream you are always gaining ground and making your way
  towards the higher levels, while you avoid bogs: for the edge of a
  stream is generally the dryest part of a mountain.</p>

  <p>Choosing the broadest and deepest scaur that is scratched down the
  abrupt side of the lower range of the mountain, we find it, as we
  anticipated, the channel of a clear dancing stream, which amuses us
  with its babble for several hundred feet of the ascent. Some time ere
  we had reached the base of the hill we had lost sight of the summit,
  and there was before us only the broad steep bank, with its surface
  of alternate stone and heather, and a few birch-trees peeping timidly
  forth from crevices in the rock. After a considerable period of good
  hard climbing, accompanied by nothing worthy of note either in the
  variations of the scenery or in the <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span> incidents encountered,
  we are at the top of this rampart; and behold! on the other side of a
  slight depression, in which sleeps a small inky lake, the bold summit
  of the mountain rises clear and abrupt and close, as one might see
  the dome of a cathedral from the parapet on the roof. Here we linger
  to take a last look of the objects at the foot of the hill, for ere
  we resume the ascent we shall lose sight of them. Already Fort
  William looks like a collection of rabbit-houses. The steam-boat on
  the lake is like a boy&#39;s Christmas toy. The waters have assumed
  that hard burnished metallic appearance which they convey to the eye
  raised far above them in a hot summer day. The far-stretching moss,
  with one or two ghastly white stones standing erect out of its
  blackness like druidical remains, carries the eye along its surface
  to the dusky and mysterious ruins of Inverlochy Castle, which has so
  sadly puzzled antiquaries to divine how its princely round towers and
  broad barbican could have been erected in that wild and remote
  region, where they stand patiently in their ruined grandeur, waiting
  till our friend Billings shall, with his incomparable pencil, make
  each tower and arch and moulding as familiar to the public eye as if
  the old ruin stood in Fleet Street.</p>

  <p>Off we start with the lake to the left, taking care to keep the
  level we have gained. A short interval of walking in a horizontal
  direction, and again we must begin to climb. On this side the
  porphyry dome is round and comparatively smooth&#8212;scarcely so
  abrupt as the outer range of hill which we have just ascended. But
  wending north-eastwardly when near the summit, we came suddenly to a
  spot where a huge fragment of the dome had, as it were, been broken
  off, leaving a ghastly rent&#8212;how deep it were difficult for the
  eye to fix, but the usual authorities tell us that the precipices
  here are 1500 feet high. When we reached their edge, we found that
  the clouds, which had been completely lifted up from the smoother
  parts of the mountain, still lingered as if they had difficulty in
  getting clear of the ragged edges of the cavernous opening, and
  moving about restlessly like evil spirits, hither and thither,
  afforded but partial glimpses of the deep vale below. Though Ben
  Nevis was at this time rather deficient in his snowy honours,
  considerable patches lay in the unsunned crevices of the precipice.
  It was a fine thing to occupy one&#39;s-self in tilting over huge
  boulders, and to see them gradually approach the edge of the gulf,
  and then leap thundering into the mist.</p>

  <p>Turning our eyes from the terrible fascinations of the precipice
  to the apex of the hill now in full view, a strange sight there met
  our eyes&#8212;a sight so strange that we venture to say the reader
  no more anticipates it than we did, at the moment when we looked from
  the yawning precipice to what we expected to be a solitary
  mountain-top. &quot;Pooh!&quot; the reader will say, &quot;it was an
  eagle looking at the sun, or a red-deer snuffing with his expanded
  nostrils the tainted air.&quot; We shake our heads. &quot;Well, then,
  it was a waterspout&#8212;or, perhaps, a beautiful rainbow&#8212;or
  something electric, or a phenomenon of some sort.&quot; Utterly
  wrong. It was neither more nor less, reader, than a crowd of
  soldiers, occupying nearly the whole table-land of the summit! Yes,
  there they were, British troops, with their red coats, dark gray
  trousers, and fatigue caps, as distinctly as we ever saw them in
  Marshall&#39;s panoramas! We were reminded of the fine description
  which Scott gives of the Highland girl who was gazing indolently
  along the solitary glen of Gortuleg on the day of the battle of
  Culloden, when it became suddenly peopled by the Jacobite fugitives.
  &quot;Impressed with the belief that they were fairies&#8212;who,
  according to Highland tradition, are visible to men only from one
  twinkle of the eyelid to another&#8212;she strove to refrain from the
  vibration, which she believed would occasion the strange and
  magnificent apparition to become invisible.&quot; But whether the eye
  winked or not, there they were&#8212;substantial able-bodied fellows;
  what could it mean? Had Colonel Mitchell discovered a new system for
  protecting the country by fortifying the tops of mountains which an
  enemy never comes near? Could it be some awkward squad sent to be
  drilled on this remote spot that it might escape the observation of
  the sarcastic public? <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id=
  "Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span> Such were the theories as suddenly
  rejected as they were suggested. It was vain to speculate. No
  solution we could devise made the slightest approach to probability;
  and our only prospect of speedy relief was in pushing rapidly
  forward. A very short sentence from the good-humoured looking young
  fellow who received our first breathless and perplexed inquiry,
  solved the mystery,&#8212;&quot;did you never hear of the Ordnance
  Survey?&quot; Yes, indeed, we had heard of it; but our impression of
  it was as of something like a mathematical line, with neither breadth
  nor thickness; but here it was in substantial operation. The party
  were occupied in erecting a sort of dwelling for
  themselves&#8212;half tent, half hut. Though in fatigue dresses, and
  far from being very trim, it was easy to see that they were not
  common soldiers. They belong, we believe, to the educated corps of
  sappers and miners; and a short conversation with them showed that
  the reputation of intelligence and civility long enjoyed by that
  distinguished body has not been unjustly earned. Though not blind to
  the magnificence of the panorama of mountain, lake, and distant
  far-stretching forest-land that lay beneath our feet as we conversed,
  they did not conceal their consciousness that the prospect of passing
  some months on such a spot was not particularly cheering to
  round-cheeked comfortable Englishmen, accustomed at Sandhurst and
  Addiscombe to comforts even superior to those of the Saut Market. The
  air was unexceptionably pure and abundant&#8212;yet the Bedford level
  might have been preferable as a permanent residence. Many were the
  reflections that occurred to us of the feelings of a set of men thus
  cut off from the earth, down on which they looked, like so many Jacks
  on a huge bean-stalk. What a place to encounter the first burst of
  the November storm in, beneath the frail covering of a tent! How did
  their friends address letters to them? Would a cover addressed
  &quot;Mr Abel Thompson of the Royal engineers, Top of Ben
  Nevis,&quot; be a document to which the post-office would pay any
  more regard than to a letter addressed to one of the fixed stars?
  Could they ask a friend to step up to dinner, or exchange courtesies
  with the garrison of Fort William, into whose windows they might peep
  with their telescopes?</p>

  <p>In the course of conversation with our new friends, we alighted on
  a subject in which we have long taken an interest. They had already
  conducted some operations on Ben Muich Dhui, and they were now
  commencing such surveys on Ben Nevis, as would enable them finally to
  decide which of these mountains has the honour of being the highest
  land in the United Kingdom. Competition has of late run very close
  between them; and the last accounts had shown Ben Muich Dhui only
  some twenty feet or so a-head. We freely confess that we back Ben
  Muich Dhui in this contest. It is true that Ben Nevis is in all
  respects a highly meritorious hill. We must do justice to his manly
  civility and good humour. We have found many a crabbed little crag
  more difficult of access; and, for his height, we scarcely know
  another mountain, of which it is so easy to reach the top. He stands
  majestic and alone, his own spurs more nearly rivalling him than any
  of the neighbouring hills. Rising straight from the sea, his whole
  height and magnificent proportions are before us at once, and the
  view from the summit has an unrivalled expanse. Still there are
  stronger charms about the great centre of the Cairngorm range.
  Surrounded by his peers, he stands apart from the every-day world in
  mysterious grandeur. The depth and remoteness of the solitude, the
  huge mural precipices, the deep chasms between the rocks, the
  waterfalls of unknown height, the hoary remains of the primeval
  forest, the fields of snow, and the deep black lakes at the foot of
  the precipices, are full of such associations of awe, and grandeur,
  and mystery, as no other scenery in Britain is capable of arousing.
  The recollections of these things inclined us still to favour Ben
  Muich Dhui; and before separating from these hermits of her
  Majesty&#39;s ordnance, we earnestly requested, if they had any
  influence in the matter, that they would &quot;find&quot; for our
  favourite, to which we shall now introduce our readers.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg
  152]</a></span> Our public are certainly not amenable to the charge
  of neglecting what is worth seeing, because it is distant and
  inaccessible. On the top of the Righi, where people go to behold the
  sun rise over the Alps, we have seen the English congregated in
  crowds on the wooden bench erected for that purpose, making it look
  like a race-course stand, and carrying on a bang-up sort of
  conversation&#8212;</p>

  </div>

  <p>as if it were a starting-post, and they were laying bets on the
  events of the day. The Schwartzwald, the Saxon Schweitz, nay, even
  the wild Norrska Fiellen, swarm with British tourists; and we are
  credibly informed that loud cries of &quot;boots&quot; and
  &quot;waiter,&quot; with expostulations against the quality of the
  bottled porter and the airing of the beds, may be heard not far from
  Mount Sinai. Yet, in the centre of our own island there is a group of
  scenery, as unlike the rest of the country as if we had travelled to
  another hemisphere to see it&#8212;as grand and beautiful as the
  objects which our tourists cross half the globe to behold&#8212;which
  is scarcely known to those who profess to say that they have visited
  every thing that is worth seeing in their own country. The answer to
  this will probably be, that railway travelling has brought the
  extremities of Europe together&#8212;that Switzerland is but four
  days from London&#8212;that it is as easy to get to Chamouni as to
  Braemar&#8212;and that the scenery of the Alps <i>must</i> be finer
  than any thing to be seen in Scotland. Even this broad proposition
  may be questioned. It was with no small pride that one night, after a
  hard walk from Martigny to Chamouni, we heard a distinguished
  Englishman, who has been able to compare with each other the finest
  things both physical and mental which the world has produced, and
  whose friendly face greeted us as we emerged from the dark valley
  into a brilliantly lighted hotel&#8212;stand up for old Scotland, and
  question if there were any thing, even in the gorgeous vale of
  Chamouni itself, to excel our purple mountains and narrow glens. But
  if we should be disposed to give the preference to the Alps, on that
  principle of politeness, which actuated an Aberdeen fisherman, who
  had found his way under the dome of St Paul&#39;s, to
  exclaim&#8212;&quot;Weel, that jist maks a perfect feel o&#39; the
  Kirk o&#39; Fitty&quot;&#8212;we think there is something
  inexpressibly interesting in beholding, in the middle of this busy
  island of steam-engines and railways, of printing machines and
  spinning jennies, one wide district where nature is still as
  supremely lord of all&#8212;where man feels as much separated from
  all traces of the workmanship of his fellows, as in the forests of
  Missouri, or the upper gorges of the Himalayas. But it is not true
  that the Cairngorm range of mountains is a distant place to tourists.
  It is in the very centre of their haunts. They swarm in the valleys
  of the Spey and the Tay, at Laggan, Blair Athol, and Braemar, and
  want but enterprise or originality enough to direct their steps out
  of the beaten paths which have formed, since Scottish touring became
  fashionable forty years ago, the regular circles in which these
  creatures revolve. They care not in general to imbibe the glories and
  the delights of scenery, but confine themselves to the established
  Lions, which it is good for a man to be able in society to <i>say</i>
  that he has seen. &quot;Well, I can say I have seen it,&quot; says
  your routine tourist&#8212;whereby, if he knew the meaning of his own
  words, he would be aware that he conveyed to mankind a testimony to
  his folly in having made any effort to look at that which has
  produced no impression whatever on his mind, and in looking at which
  he would not be aware that he saw any thing remarkable, unless the
  guide-book and the waiter at the inn had certified that it was an
  object of interest. It is true, that to see our friends the Cairngorm
  hills, one must walk, and that somewhat stiffly&#8212;but this is
  seldom an obstacle in any place where pedestrianism is not
  unfashionable. In the Oberland of Switzerland, we have seen
  green-spectacled, fat, plethoric, gentlemen, fresh from &#39;Change,
  wearing blouses and broad straw hats, carrying haversacks on their
  shoulders, and tall alpenstocks in their hands to facilitate the
  leaping of the chasms in the glaciers&#8212;looking all the time
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg
  153]</a></span>as if the whole were some disagreeable dream, from
  which they hoped to awaken in their easy-chair in the back office in
  Crane Alley. No! when personages of this kind adopt the pilgrim&#39;s
  staff, we may be sure that there is a good fund of pedestrianism
  still unexhausted, could the means of stimulating it be found. But it
  is high time that we should point out the way to our favourite land
  of precipices, cataracts, and snow.</p>

  <p>We shall suppose the traveller to be at Braemar, which he may have
  reached by the Deeside road from Aberdeen, or in the direction of
  Spital of Glenshee through the pass of the Vhrich-vhruich, (have the
  goodness, reader, to pronounce that aloud,) or from the basin of the
  Tay by the ancient Highland road through Glen Tilt, and the
  Ault-Shiloch-Vran. Even the scenery round Braemar is in every way
  worthy of respect. The hills are fine, there are noble forests of
  pine and birch, and some good foaming waterfalls; while over all
  preside in majesty the precipices and snow of Lochin-ye-gair. Still
  it is farther into the wilderness, at the place where the three
  counties of Aberdeen, Inverness, and Banff meet, that the traveller
  must look for the higher class of scenery of which we are sending him
  in search. As Braemar, however, contains the latest inn that will
  greet him in his journey, he must remember here to victual himself
  for the voyage; and, partial as we are to pedestrianism, we think he
  may as well take a vehicle or a Highland poney as far on his route as
  either of them can go: it will not long encumber him. The linn of
  Dee, where the river rushes furiously between two narrow rocks, is
  generally the most remote object visited by the tourist on Dee-side.
  There is little apparent inducement to farther progress. He sees
  before him, about a mile farther on, the last human
  habitation&#8212;a shepherd&#39;s cabin, without an inch of
  cultivated land about it; and he is told that all beyond that is
  barrenness and desolation, until he reach the valley of the Spey. The
  pine-trees at the same time decrease in number, the hills become less
  craggy and abrupt, and the country in general assumes a bleak, bare,
  windy, bog-and-moor appearance, that is apt to make, one
  uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>Of the various methods of approaching Ben Muich Dhui, the most
  striking, in our opinion, is one with which we never found any other
  person so well acquainted as to exchange opinions with us about it.
  We did once, it is true, coax a friend to attempt that route; he had
  come so far with us as the edge of the Dee, but disliked crossing it.
  In the superabundance of our zeal, we offered to carry him over on
  our shoulders; but when we came to the middle of the stream, it so
  happened that a foot tripped against a stone, and our friend was very
  neatly tilted over our head into the water, without our receiving any
  considerable damage, in our own proper person. He thereafter looked
  upon us, according to an old Scottish proverb, as &quot;not to ride
  the water with;&quot; and perhaps he was right. So we proceeded on
  our journey alone. Our method was to cross right over the line of
  hills which here bound the edge of the river. Though not precipitous,
  this bank is very high&#8212;certainly not less than a thousand feet.
  When you reach the top, if the day be clear, the whole Cairngorm
  range is before you on the other side of the valley, from summit to
  base, as you may see Mont Blanc from the Col de Balm, or the Jungfrau
  from the Wengern Alp. From this bird&#39;s-eye view, you at once
  understand that peculiar structure of the group, which makes the
  valleys so much deeper and narrower, and the precipices so much more
  frightful, than those of any other of the Scottish mountains. Here
  there are five summits springing from one root, and all more than
  four thousand feet above the level of the sea. The circumference of
  the whole group is as that of one mountain. We can imagine it to have
  been a huge, wide, rounded hill, Ben Muich Dhui being the highest
  part, and the whole as smooth and gentle as some of the Ural range,
  where you might have a fixed engine, and &quot;an incline,&quot;
  without levelling or embanking. But at some time or other the whole
  mass had got a jerk; and so it is split from top to bottom, and
  shivered, and shaken, and disturbed into all shapes and positions,
  showing here and there such chasms <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span> as the splitting in two
  of mountains some three thousand feet or so in direct height must
  necessarily create. Having to his satisfaction contemplated the group
  from this elevation, the traveller may descend into Glen Lui Beg, as
  we shall presently describe it.</p>

  <p>Returning to the Dee,&#8212;about a mile below the Linn, the
  stream of the Lui forces a passage through the steep banks and joins
  the river. We enter the glen from which this stream flows by a narrow
  rocky pass, through which the trees of the Mar forest struggle
  upwards. As we proceed, the trees gradually become more scarce, the
  rocky barrier is left behind us, and we are in a long grassy glen
  shut out from the world. This is Glen Lui. A better introduction to
  the savage scenery beyond, for the sake of contrast, there could not
  be. Every thing here is peace and softness. Banks lofty, but round
  and smooth, intervene to hide the summits of the mountains. The
  stream is not stagnant, but it flows on with a gentle current,
  sometimes through sedge or between grassy banks; elsewhere edged by a
  beach of the finest yellow sand. The water is beautifully
  transparent, and even where it is deepest you may count the shining
  pebbles below. A few weeping birches here and there hang their
  graceful disconsolate ringlets almost into the stream; the grass is
  as smooth as a shaven lawn, and much softer; and where a few stones
  protrude through it, they are covered with a cushion of many-coloured
  mosses. But with all its softness and beauty, the extreme loneliness
  of the scene fills the mind with a sense of awe. It surely must have
  been in such a spot that Wordsworth stood, or of such a scene that he
  dreamed, when he gave that picture of perfect rest which he professed
  to apply to a far different spot, Glen Almon&#8212;a rough, rocky
  glen, with a turbulent brook running through it, where there never
  was or can be silence:</p>

  <div>
    <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">&quot;A convent&#8212;even a
    hermit&#39;s cell</span><br />
    <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Would break the silence of this
    dell&#8212;</span><br />
    <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">It is not quiet&#8212;is not
    ease,</span><br />
    <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">But something deeper far than
    these.</span><br />
    <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">The separation that is
    here</span><br />
    <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Is of the grave, and of
    austere</span><br />
    <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">And happy feelings of the
    dead.&quot;</span><br />
  </div>

  <p>Nor in Glen Lui can one feel inclined to join in the charge of
  mysticism which has been raised against this last simile. Its echoes
  in the heart at once associate themselves with a few strange,
  mysterious, round mounds, of the smoothest turf, and of the most
  regular, oval, or circular construction, which rise here and there
  from the flat floor of the valley. It needs no archÃ¦ological inquiry
  to tell us what they are: we feel that they cover and have
  covered&#8212;who call tell how many hundred years?&#8212;the remains
  of some ancient people, with whom history cannot make us acquainted,
  and who have not even the benefit of tradition; for how can there be
  traditions in places where no human beings dwell?</p>

  <div>
    <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">&quot;A noble race, but they are
    gone!</span><br />
    <span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">With their old forests wide and
    deep;</span><br />
    <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">And we have fed our flocks
    upon</span><br />
    <span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">Hills where their generations
    sleep.</span><br />
    <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Their fountains slake our thirst
    at noon,</span><br />
    <span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">Upon their fields our harvest
    waves;</span><br />
    <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Our shepherds woo beneath their
    moon&#8212;</span><br />
    <span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">Ah, let us spare at least their
    graves!&quot;</span><br />
  </div>

  <p>&quot;Stop!&quot; says a voice, &quot;the quotation is utterly
  inappropriate&#8212;how can there be flocks where not even a single
  sheep feeds&#8212;how can shepherds woo beneath the moon where there
  are no damsels to woo?&quot; Granted; but the lines are
  pretty&#8212;they were the most appropriate that we could find, and
  they blend in with one&#39;s feelings on this spot; for, if it be a
  strange and melancholy sight in the Far West, beyond the Atlantic, to
  alight upon the graves of a tribe of Indians whose history has become
  extinct, is it not more strange still to look, in the centre of this
  busy island, which has lived in history eighteen hundred years, on
  these vestiges of an old extinct race, not turned up by the plough,
  or found in digging the foundation of a cotton mill, but remaining
  there beneath the open sky, as they were left of old, no successors
  of the aboriginal race coming to touch them? Standing in Glen Lui,
  and remembering how fast we are peopling Australia and the Oregon,
  one&#39;s mind becomes confused about the laws of emigration and
  colonisation. Yet how soon may all this be changed. Perhaps the glen
  may turn out to be <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id=
  "Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span> a good trunk level&#8212;the granite
  of Ben Muich Dhui peculiarly well adapted for tunnelling, and the
  traffic something of an unknown and indescribable extent: and some
  day soon the silence may be awakened with the fierce whistle of the
  train, and the bell may ring, and passengers may be ordered to be
  ready to take their places, and first, second, and third class
  tickets may be stamped with the rapidity of button-making&#8212;who
  knows? Nobody should prophesy in this age what may <i>not</i> be
  done. We once met a woful instance of a character for great sagacity
  utterly lost at one blow, in consequence of such a prediction. The
  man had engaged to eat the first locomotive that ever came to
  Manchester by steam from Liverpool. On the day when this marvel was
  accomplished, he received a polite note enclosing a piece of leather
  cut from the machinery, with an intimation that when he had digested
  <i>that</i>, the rest of the engine would be at his service. But
  the reader is getting tired of Glen Lui, and insists on being led
  into more exciting scenery.</p>

  <p>After being for a few miles such as we have tried to describe it,
  the glen becomes narrower, and the scenery rougher. Granite masses
  crop out here and there. The pretty dejected weeping birches become
  mixed with stern, stiff, surly pines, which look as if they could
  &quot;do any thing but weep,&quot; and not unnaturally suggest the
  notion that their harsh conduct may be the cause of the tears of
  their gentler companions. At last a mountain thrusts a spur into the
  glen, and divides it into two: we are here at the foot of Cairngorm
  of Derrie, or the lesser Cairngorm. The valley opening to the left is
  Glen Lui Beg, or Glen Luithe Little&#8212;containing the shortest and
  best path to the top of Ben Muich Dhui. The other to the right is
  Glen Derrie&#8212;one of the passes towards Loch A&#39;an or Avon,
  and the basin of the Spey. Both these glens are alike in character.
  The precipitous sides of the great mountains between which they run,
  frown over them and fill them with gloom. The two streams of which
  the united waters lead so peaceful a wedded life in calm Glen Lui,
  are thundering torrents, chafing among rocks, and now and then
  starting unexpectedly at our feet down into deep black pools, making
  cataracts which, in the regular touring districts, would be visited
  by thousands. But the marked feature of these glens is the ancient
  forest. Somewhere we believe in Glen Derrie there are the remains of
  a saw-mill, showing that an attempt had been at one time made to
  apply the forest to civilised purposes; but it was a vain attempt,
  and neither the Baltic timber duties, nor the demand for railway
  sleepers, has brought the axe to the root of the tree beneath the
  shadow of Ben Muich Dhui. There are noble trees in the neighbouring
  forest of Braemar, but it is not in a state of nature. The flat stump
  occurs here and there, showing that commerce has made her selection,
  and destroyed the ancient unity of the forest. In Glen Derrie, the
  tree lives to its destined old age, and whether falling from decay,
  or swept to the ground by the tempest, lies and rots, stopping
  perhaps the course of some small stream, and by solution in the
  intercepted waters forming a petty peat-bog, which, after a
  succession of generations, becomes hardened and encrusted with
  lichens. Near such a mass of vegetable corruption and reorganisation,
  lies the new-fallen tree with its twigs still full of sap. Around
  them stand the hoary fathers of the forest, whose fate will come
  next. They bear the scars and contortions of many a hard-fought
  battle with the storms that often sweep the narrow glen. Some are
  bent double, with their heads nearly touching the earth; and among
  other fantastic forms it is not unusual to see the trunk of some aged
  warrior twisted round and round, its outer surface resembling the
  strands of a rope. A due proportion of the forest is still in its
  manly prime&#8212;tall, stout, straight trees, lifting their huge
  branches on high, and bearing aloft the solemn canopy of dark green
  that distinguishes &quot;the scarcely waving pine.&quot; We are
  tempted to have recourse to poetry again&#8212;we promise it shall be
  the last time on this occasion: there are, however, some lines by
  Campbell &quot;on leaving a scene in Bavaria,&quot; which describe
  such a region of grandeur, loneliness, and desolation, with a vigour
  and melody that have been seldom equalled. They were first
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg
  156]</a></span> published not many years before his death, and it
  seemed as if the ancient harp had been re-strung to more than its old
  compass and power&#8212;but, alas! when we spoke of these verses to
  himself, we found that, like all of his that were fitted for
  immortality, they had been the fruit of his younger and better days,
  and that a diffidence of their merit had retarded their publication.
  Let the reader commit these two stanzas to memory, and repeat them as
  he nears the base of Ben Muich Dhui.</p>

  <div>
    <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">&quot;Yes! I have loved thy wild
    abode,</span><br />
    <span style="margin-left: 4em;">Unknown, unploughed, untrodden
    shore;</span><br />
    <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Where scarce the woodman finds a
    road,</span><br />
    <span style="margin-left: 4em;">And scarce the fisher plies an
    oar;</span><br />
    <span style="margin-left: 4em;">For man&#39;s neglect I love thee
    more;</span><br />
    <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">That art nor avarice
    intrude,&#8212;</span><br />
    <span style="margin-left: 4em;">To tame thy torrents&#39;
    thunder-shock,</span><br />
    <span style="margin-left: 4em;">Or prune thy vintage of the
    rock,</span><br />
    <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Magnificently rude.</span><br />
    <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Unheeded spreads thy blossomed
    bud</span><br />
    <span style="margin-left: 4em;">Its milky bosom to the
    bee;</span><br />
    <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Unheeded falls along the
    flood</span><br />
    <span style="margin-left: 4em;">Thy desolate and aged
    tree.</span><br />
    <span style="margin-left: 4em;">Forsaken scene! how like to
    thee</span><br />
    <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">The fate of unbefriended
    worth!</span><br />
    <span style="margin-left: 4em;">Like thine, her fruit unhonoured
    falls&#8212;</span><br />
    <span style="margin-left: 4em;">Like thee, in solitude she
    calls</span><br />
    <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">A thousand treasures
    forth.&quot;</span><br />
  </div>

  <p>It is after proceeding through Glen Lui Beg, perhaps about three
  or four miles from the opening of the glen, that we begin to mount
  Ben Muich Dhui. At first we clamber over the roots and fallen trunks
  of trees; but by degrees we leave the forest girdle behind, and
  precipices and snow, with a scant growth of heather, become our sole
  companions. Keeping the track where the slope of the hill is
  gentlest, we pass on the right Loch Etichan, lying like a drop of ink
  at the base of a huge dark mural precipice&#8212;yet it is not so
  small when seen near at hand. This little tarn, with its back-ground
  of dark rocks interspersed with patches of snow, might strongly
  remind the Alpine traveller of the lake near the Hospice of the
  Grimsel. The two scenes are alike hard and leafless and
  frozen-like&#8212;but the Alpine pass is one of the highways of
  Europe, and thus one seldom crosses it without encountering a pilgrim
  here and there. But few are the travellers that pass the edge of Loch
  Etichan, and if the adventurous tourist desires company, he had
  better try to find an eagle&#8212;not even the red-deer, we should
  suppose, when driven to his utmost need, seeks such a shelter, and as
  for foxes and wild-cats they know too well the value of comfortable
  quarters in snug glens, to expose themselves to catch cold in so
  Greenland-like a region.</p>

  <p>The climber will know that he is at the top of Ben Muich Dhui,
  when he has to scramble no longer over scaurs or ledges of rock, but
  walking on a gentle ascent of turf, finds a cairn at its highest
  part. When he stands on this cairn, he is entitled to consider
  himself the most elevated personage in the United Kingdom. Around it
  is spread something like a table-land, and one can go round the edges
  of the table, and look down on the floor, where the Dee, the Avon,
  the Lui, and many other streams, are seen like silver threads, while
  their forest banks resemble beds of mignionette or young boxwood.
  There are at several points prodigious precipices, from which one may
  contemplate the scene below; but we recommend caution to the
  adventurer, as ugly blasts sometimes sweep along the top.</p>

  <p>When a mountain is the chief of a district, we generally see from
  the top a wide expanse of country. Other mountains are seen, but wide
  valleys intervene, and thus they are carried to a graceful distance.
  Probably, more summits are seen from Ben Nevis, than from any other
  height in Scotland, but none of them press so closely on the monarch
  as even to tread upon his spurs. The whole view is distant and
  panoramic. It is quite otherwise with Ben Muich Dhui. Separated from
  it only by narrow valleys, which some might call mere clefts, are
  Cairn Toul, Brae Riach, Cairn Gorm, Ben Avon, and
  Ben-y-Bourd&#8212;all, we believe, ascending more than four thousand
  feet above the level of the sea&#8212;along with several other
  mountains which very closely approach that fine round number. The
  vicinity of some of these summits to Ben Muich Dhui has something
  frightful in it. Standing on the western shoulder of the hill, you
  imagine that you might throw a stone to the top of Brae
  Riach&#8212;we have been so <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157"
  id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span> much deceived by distance as to
  have seriously made the attempt, we shall not venture to say how many
  years ago. Yet, between these two summits rolls the river Dee; and
  Brae Riach presents right opposite to the hill on which we stand, a
  mural precipice, said to be two thousand feet high&#8212;an estimate
  which no one who looks on it will be inclined to doubt. Brae Riach,
  indeed, is unlike any thing else in Scotland. It is not properly a
  hill, but a long wall of precipice, extending several miles along the
  valley of the Dee. Even in the sunniest weather it is black as
  midnight, but in a few inequalities on its smooth surface, the snow
  lies perpetually. Seldom is the cleft between the two great summits
  free of clouds, which flit hither and thither, adding somewhat to the
  mysterious awfulness of the gulf, and seeming in their motions to
  cause certain deep but faint murmurs, which are in reality the
  mingled sounds of the many torrents which course through the glens,
  far, far below.</p>

  <p>Having had a satisfactory gaze at Brae Riach,&#8212;looking across
  the street, as it were, to the interesting and mysterious house on
  the opposite side,&#8212;the traveller may probably be reflecting on
  the best method of descending. There is little hope, we may as well
  inform him, of his return to Braemar to-night, unless he be a person
  of more than ordinary pedestrian acquirements. For such a
  consummation, he may have prepared himself according to his own
  peculiar ideas. If he be a tea-totaller, he will have brought with
  him a large bottle of lemonade and some oranges&#8212;we wish him
  much satisfaction in the consumption of them, and hope they will keep
  his outer and inner man warm after the dews of eve have descended.
  Perhaps his most prudent course (we consider ourselves bound to give
  discreet advice, for perhaps we may have led some heedless person
  into a scrape) will be to get down to Loch Avon, and sleep under the
  Stone of Shelter. Proceeding along the table-land of the hill, in a
  direction opposite to that by which he has ascended, the traveller
  comes to a slight depression. If he descend, and then ascend the bank
  towards the north-east, he will find himself on the top of a
  precipice the foot of which is washed by the Loch. But this is a
  dangerous windy spot: the ledge projects far out, and there is so
  little shelter near it, that, from beneath, it has the appearance of
  overhanging the waters. It is not an essential part of the route we
  are about to suggest, and we would rather decline the responsibility
  of recommending it to the attention of any one who is not a practised
  cragsman. In the depression we have just mentioned will be found,
  unless the elements have lately changed their arrangements and
  operations, the largest of those fields of snow which, even in the
  heat of summer, dispute with the heath and turf the pre-eminence on
  the upper ranges of Ben Muich Dhui. If we were desirous of using
  high-sounding expressions, we would call this field a glacier, but it
  must be at once admitted that it does not possess the qualities that
  have lately made these frigid regions a matter of ardent scientific
  inquiry. There are no icebergs or fissures; and the mysterious
  principle of motion which keeps these congealed oceans in a state of
  perpetual restlessness is unknown in the smooth snow-fields of Ben
  Muich Dhui. But there are some features common to both. The
  snow-field, like the glacier, is hardened by pressure into a
  consistence resembling that of ice. A curious thing it is to topple a
  huge stone down from a neighbouring precipice on one of these
  snow-fields, and see how it hits the snow without sinking in it, and
  bounds along, leaving no scratch on the hardened surface. A stream
  issues from the field we are now alluding to, formed like the glacier
  streams from the ceaseless melting of the snow. It passes forth
  beneath a diminutive arch, such as the source of the Rhine might
  appear through a diminishing glass; and looking through this arch to
  the interior of the hardened snow, we see exemplified the sole
  pleasing peculiarity of the glacier&#8212;the deep blue tint that it
  assumes in the interior of the fissures, and on the tops of the
  arches whence the waters issue. This field of snow, which we believe
  has never been known to perspire so much in the hottest season as to
  evaporate altogether, constitutes the main source of the <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span> Avon.
  The little stream, cold and leafless though it be, is not without its
  beauties. Rarely have we seen such brilliant mosses as those which
  cluster round its source: their extreme freshness may probably be
  accounted for by remembering that every summer day deducts so much
  from the extent of the snow-field, and that the turf in its immediate
  neighbourhood has just been uncovered, and, relieved from prison, is
  enjoying the first fresh burst of spring in July or August. For our
  own part we think this region of fresh moss is quite worthy of
  comparison with the far-famed <i>Jardin of the TalÃ¨fre</i>, which we
  find described in Murray&#39;s hand-book as &quot;an oasis in the
  desert, an island in the ice&#8212;a rock which is covered with a
  beautiful herbage, and enamelled in August with flowers. This is the
  Jardin of this palace of nature, and nothing can exceed the beauty of
  such a spot, amidst the overwhelming sublimity of the surrounding
  objects, the Aiguilles of Charmoz, BletiÃ¨re, and the GÃ©ant,&quot;
  &amp;c. &quot;Herbage,&quot; &quot;flowers&quot;!! Why, the jardin is
  merely a rock protruding out of the glacier, and covered with
  lichens; but, after all, was it reasonable to expect a better
  flower-show ten thousand feet above the level of the sea, and some
  nine thousand or so above all horticultural societies and prize
  exhibitions?</p>

  <p>As we follow the course of the little stream, it becomes gradually
  enlarged by contributions from subsidiary snow streams; and winds
  along for some distance not inconsiderable in the volume of its
  waters, passing through a beautiful channel of fine sand, probably
  formed of the <i>detritus</i> of the granite rocks, swept along by
  the floods, caused by the melting of the snow in spring. The water is
  exquisitely clear&#8212;a feature which at once deprives it of all
  right to be considered glacier-born; for filth is the peculiarity of
  the streams claiming this high origin, and none can have seen without
  regretting it, the Rhone, after having washed itself clean in the
  Lake Leman, and come forth a sapphire blue, becoming afterwards as
  dirty as ever, because it happens to fall in company with an old
  companion, the Arve, which, having never seen good society, or had an
  opportunity of making itself respectable, by the mere force of its
  native character, brings its reformed brother back to his original
  mire, and accompanies him in that plight through the respectable city
  of Lyons, till both plunge together into the great ocean, where all
  the rivers of the earth, be they blue or yellow, clear or boggy,
  classical or obscure, become alike indistinguishable.</p>

  <p>Perhaps our traveller is becoming tired of this small pleasant
  stream running along a mere declivity of the table-land of Ben Muich
  Dhui. But he will not be long distressed by its peaceful monotony.
  Presently, as he comes in sight of the valley below, and Loch Avon
  lying in a small pool at the base of the dizzy height, the stream
  leaps at once from the edge of the hill, and disappears for a time,
  reappearing again far down in a narrow thread, as white as the snow
  from which it has issued. Down the wide channel, which the stream
  occupies in its moments of fulness and pride&#8212;moments when it is
  all too terrible to be approached by mortal footsteps&#8212;the
  traveller must find his way; and, if he understand his business, he
  may, by judiciously adapting to his purpose the many ledges and
  fractures caused by the furious bursts of the flooded stream, and by
  a judicious system of zig-zagging, convert the channel, so far as he
  is himself concerned, into a sort of rough staircase, some two
  thousand feet or so in length. The torrent itself takes a more direct
  course; and he who has descended by the ravine may well look up with
  wonder at what has the appearance of a continuous cataract, which,
  falling a large mass of waters at his feet, seems as if it diminished
  and disappeared in the heavens. The Staubbach, or Fall of Dust, in
  Lauter Brunen, is beyond question a fine object. The water is thrown
  sheer off the edge of a perpendicular rock, and reaches the ground in
  a massive shower nine hundred feet high. But with all respect for
  this wonder of the world, we are scarcely disposed to admit that it
  is a grander fall than this rumbling, irregular, unmeasured cataract
  which tumbles through the cleft between Ben Muich Dhui and Ben Avon.
  We should not omit, by the way, for the benefit of those who are
  better acquainted with Scottish than with Con <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
  tinental scenery, to notice the resemblance of this torrent to the
  Gray Mare&#39;s Tail in Moffat-dale. In the character both of the
  stream itself and in the immediate scenery there are many points of
  resemblance, every thing connected with the Avon being of course on
  the larger scale.</p>

  <p>Our wanderer has perhaps indulged himself in the belief that he
  has been traversing these solitudes quite alone&#8212;how will he
  feel if he shall discover that he has been accompanied in every step
  and motion by a shadowy figure of huge proportions and savage mien,
  flourishing in his band a great pine-tree, in ghastly parallel with
  all the motions of the traveller&#39;s staff? Such are the spirits of
  the air haunting this howling wilderness, where the pale sheeted
  phantom of the burial vault or the deserted cloister would lose all
  his terrors and feel himself utterly insignificant. Sometimes the
  phantom&#39;s head is large and his body small, then he receives the
  name of Fahin. James Hogg has asserted, not only poetically, but in
  sober prose, that, he was acquainted with a man who</p>

  <div>
    <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">&quot;Beheld the fahin glide
    o&#39;er the fell.&quot;</span><br />
  </div>

  <p>For ourselves, are bound to confess that we never had the honour
  of meeting with this megacephalous gentleman, nor did we ever
  encounter any one who professed to have seen him, otherwise we would
  certainly have reported the case to the Phrenological Society. But we
  no more doubt his existence than that of the spectre of the Brocken.
  Sometimes the shadowy spectre of Ben Muich Dhui is a gigantic
  exaggeration of the ordinary human form seen stalking in a line with
  the traveller&#39;s route, striding from mountain-top to mountain-top
  as <i>he</i> steps from stone to stone, and imitating on an enlarged
  scale all his gestures. The spectre has an excellent excuse for all
  this unpolite mimicry&#8212;in fact, he cannot help it, as the reader
  may infer from the following account, of one of his appearances on a
  reduced scale. The description is given by Sir Thomas Dick Lauder,
  who, along with Mr Grant of Ballindalloch, had ascended Ben Muich
  Dhui:&#8212;&quot;On descending from the top, at about half-past
  three, <span class='smcap'>p.m.</span>, an interesting optical
  appearance presented itself to our view. We had turned towards the
  east, and the sun shone on our backs, when we saw a very bright
  rainbow described on the mist before us. The bow, of beautifully
  distinct prismatic colours, formed about two-thirds of a circle, the
  extremities of which appeared to rest on the lower portion of the
  mountain. In the centre of this incomplete circle, there was
  described a luminous disc, surrounded by the prismatic colours
  displayed in concentric rings. On the disc itself, each of the party
  (three in number) as they stood at about fifty yards apart, saw his
  own figure most distinctly delineated, although those of the other
  two were invisible to him. The representation appeared of the natural
  size, and the outline of the whole person of the spectator was most
  correctly portrayed. To prove that the shadow seen by each individual
  was that of himself, we resorted to various gestures, such as waving
  our hats, flapping our plaids, &amp;c., all which motions were
  exactly followed by the airy figure. We then collected together, and
  stood as close to one another as possible, when each could see three
  shadows in the disc; his own, as distinctly as before, while those of
  his two companions were but faintly discernible.&quot;<a name=

  <p>We are now at the upper extremity of Loch Avon, or, as it is
  pronounced, Loch A&#39;an, and beside the far-famed Stone of Shelter.
  We had a standing feud with James Hogg about the extent of Loch Avon,
  ever since the day of that celebrated encampment on Dee-side. Let us
  see. Thirty years have now rolled by since that unmatched gathering
  of choice spirits&#8212;nay, seventeen have passed and gone since we
  made regretful allusion, when commemorating the Moray floods, to the
  history and fortunes of those who were then assembled. Five years
  later, the Shepherd was himself gathered to the dust; but he stuck to
  his principles to the last, and in a discussion of the subject not
  many months before his death, after he <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span> had just remarked that
  he had &quot;a blessed constitution,&quot; he reiterated his old
  statement, that Loch Avon exceeded twenty miles in length. His views
  on this subject were indeed a sort of gauge of the Shepherd&#39;s
  spirits. In his sombre moments he appeared to doubt if he were quite
  correct in insisting that the length was twenty miles; when he was in
  high spirits he would not abate one inch of the thirty. Now, when one
  man maintains that a lake is thirty miles long, and another that it
  is but a tenth part of that length, it is not always taken for
  granted that the moderate man is in the right; but on the contrary,
  paradoxical people are apt to abet his opponent, and it was provoking
  that we could never find any better authority against the Shepherd
  than his own very suspicious way of recording his experience at Loch
  Avon in a note to the <i>Queen&#39;s Wake</i>: &quot;I spent a summer
  day in visiting it. The hills were clear of mist, yet the heavens
  were extremely dark&#8212;the effect upon the scene exceeded all
  description. My mind during the whole day experienced the same sort
  of sensation as if I had been in a dream.&quot; But if our departed
  friend has left any disciples, we are now able to adduce against them
  the highest parochial authority. We are told in the new Statistical
  Account that&#8212;&quot;Loch Avon lies in the southern extremity of
  the parish, in the bosom of the Grampian mountain. It is estimated at
  <i>three miles long</i> and a mile broad. The scenery around it is
  particularly wild and magnificent. The towering sides of Ben-y-Bourd,
  Ben Muich Dhui, and Ben Bainac, rise all around it, and their rugged
  bases skirt its edges, except at the narrow outlet of the Avon at its
  eastern extremity. Its water is quite luminous, and of great depth,
  especially along its northern side. It abounds in trout of a black
  colour and slender shape, differing much in appearance from the trout
  found in the limpid stream of the Avon which issues from it. At the
  west end of the lake is the famous Clach Dhian or Shelter Stone. This
  stone is an immense block of granite, which seems to have fallen from
  a projecting rock above it, rising to the height of several hundred
  feet, and forming the broad shoulder of Ben Muich Dhui. The stone
  rests on two other blocks imbedded in a mass of rubbish, and thus
  forms a cave sufficient to contain twelve or fifteen men. Here the
  visitor to the scenery of Loch Avon takes up his abode for the night,
  and makes himself as comfortable as he can where &#39;the Queen of
  the Storm sits,&#39; and at a distance of fifteen or twenty miles
  from all human abode.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id=
  "FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class=
  "fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

  <p>At the eastern end of the lake, we stop to take a glance at the
  whole scene. Right before us stands the broad top and the mural
  precipices of Ben Avon, severing us from the north-western world. On
  the right, the scarcely less craggy sides of Ben-y-Bourd and Ben
  Bainac wall up the waters of the lake. The other side is conspicuous
  by a sharp peak of Ben Muich Dhui&#8212;the same which we already
  mentioned as seeming to hang (and it certainly does so seem from this
  point) over the edge of the water. We never saw the sun shining on
  Loch Avon; we suspect its waters, so beautifully transparent in
  themselves, are seldom visited by even a midsummer gleam. Hence
  arises a prevailing and striking feature of the scene&#8212;the
  abundant snows that fill the hollows in the banks, and sometimes,
  even in midsummer, cover the slopes of the mountains.</p>

  <p>We incline to the belief that tourists in general would consider
  Loch Avon the finest feature of the whole group of scenery which we
  have undertaken to describe. For our own part we must admit that we
  prefer the source of the Dee, to which the reader shall be presently
  introduced, as more peculiar and original. Loch Avon is like a
  fragment of the Alps imported and set down in Scotland. Our
  recollections of it invariably become intertwined and confused with
  the features of the scenery of the upper passes. The resemblance was
  particularly marked on the first of August 1836: it was a late
  season, and every portion of the mountains that did not consist of
  perpendicular <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id=
  "Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>rock appeared to be covered with snow.
  The peak of Ben Muich Dhui shot forth from the snow as like the
  Aiguilles of Mont Blanc, as one needle is like another. That was on
  the whole an adventurous day with us. We had set off from Braemar
  very early in the morning, taking a vehicle as far as it would
  penetrate through Glen Lui. The day was scarcely promising, but we
  had so long been baffled by the weather that we felt inclined at last
  to put it at defiance, or at least treat it with no respect. In Glen
  Lui every thing was calm and solemn. As we passed through Glen
  Derrie, the rain began to fall, and the wind roared among the old
  trees. The higher we ascended, the more fierce and relentless became
  the blast; and when we came within sight of Loch Avon, the
  interstices in the tempest-driven clouds only showed us a dreary,
  winter, Greenland-like chaos of snow and rocks and torrents. It taxed
  our full philosophy, both of the existence of the <i>ego</i> and the
  <i>non-ego</i>, to preserve the belief that we were still in the
  United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and that it was the
  first of August. Our indefinite projects had gradually been
  contracting themselves within a narrow compass. To reach the Stone of
  Shelter was now our utmost object of ambition, but it was clear that
  that was impracticable&#8212;so we looked about for some place of
  refuge, and with little difficulty discovered a stone about the size
  of a parish church lying like a pebble at the foot of a mountain,
  with a projecting ledge on the lee side, sufficiently large to
  protect our party. Some dry furze happened, by a singular accident,
  to lie heaped in a corner of this natural shed. With a little
  judicious management it was ignited, and burned so well as to
  overcome the wetness of a mass of thick heather roots, which we added
  to it. We were in the possession of some raw venison;&#8212;do not
  open your eyes so, reader; it was most unromantically and honestly
  come by, being duly entered in the bill at worthy Mrs Clarke&#39;s
  inn, at Braemar. Having brought certain conjuring utensils with us,
  we proceeded to cook our food and make ourselves comfortable. Water
  was easily obtained in the neighbourhood, and being in possession of
  the other essential elements of conviviality, we resolved that, as
  the weather was determined to make it winter outside, we should have
  the joys of winter within; the shrieks of the blast were drowned in
  our convivial shouts&#8212;</p>

  <div>
    <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">&quot;The storm without might
    rair and rustle,</span><br />
    <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Tam didna mind the storm a
    whistle.&quot;</span><br />
  </div>

  <p>Another adventure we remember in the same place, but that was
  long, long ago; in fact, it was when in boyhood we had first entered
  into that awful wilderness. We had reached the top of Ben Muich Dhui
  early in the day. Our little wallet of provisions we had left on a
  tuft of heather where we had lain down to rest, and we could not
  afterwards find the spot. Somewhat tired, and faint with hunger, we
  descended the rocks by the side of the cataract, believing that Loch
  Avon, seemingly so small from the summit of the mountain, was the
  little Tarn of Etichan, which had been passed in the ascent from
  Dee-side. It was alarming to find the lake extending its bulk as we
  approached, and to see the glens looking so different from any of
  those we were acquainted with on Dee-side; but to have returned up
  the mountain would have been insanity, and by pursuing the track of a
  stream, one is sure in the end&#8212;at least in this
  country&#8212;to reach inhabited land; so we followed the waters of
  the Avon, so deep and transparent, that many miles down, where they
  join the Spey, their deceptious character is embodied in the
  proverb&#8212;</p>

  <div>
    <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">&quot;The water o&#39; A&#39;an,
    it rins sae clear,</span><br />
    <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">&#39;Twould beguile a man o&#39;
    a hunder year.&quot;</span><br />
  </div>

  <p>A few miles below the exit of the stream from the loch, as the
  extreme dimness of the valley showed that sunset was approaching, we
  met a drover who had gone up into the wilderness in search of stray
  black cattle. He could speak little English, but was able to give us
  the startling intelligence that by what was merely a slight
  divergence at first, we had gone down towards the strath of the Spey
  instead of that of the Dee; and that we were some thirty miles from
  the home we <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id=
  "Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>had expected to reach that evening. Our
  new friend took us under his charge, and conducted us to a bothy,
  made of the bent roots of the pine-tree, found in the neighbouring
  mosses, and covered with turf. It was so low, that we could not stand
  upright in it, and a traveller might have walked over it without
  observing that it was an edifice made with human hands. The sole
  article of furniture, of which it could boast was a trough, in which
  our new friend hospitably presented us with a supper of oatmeal and
  water&#8212;our first nourishment for the day. The supply was
  liberal, whatever might be thought of the quality of the repast. The
  floor of the bothy was strewed with heather, somewhat coarse and
  stumpy, on which we lay down and slept. Conscious of a confused noise
  and a sort of jostling, it was with some surprise that we perceived
  that no less than ten men had crowded themselves into that little hut
  and had lighted a fire. It was like a realisation of some of
  Cooper&#39;s romantic incidents, where, after a silent desert has
  been described, it somehow or other becomes suddenly full of people
  and fertile in adventure. Our new companions were not of the most
  agreeable cast: they were rough and surly, hiding, we thought, a
  desire to avoid communication under the pretence of inability to
  speak any thing but Gaelic; while, in the midst of their Celtic
  communications with each other, they swore profusely in the Scottish
  vernacular. What their pursuits were, or what occasion they had to be
  in that wild region, was to us a complete mystery, opened up slightly
  by reflecting on the two great lawless pursuits, smuggling and
  poaching; of the fruit of neither of which, however, did we see any
  symptom. Our position was not for many reasons, great and small, to
  be envied: however, it was the best policy to make one of themselves
  for the time being, so far as their somewhat repulsive manners would
  permit. It was not, however, with much regret, that, after having
  been packed for some hours with them on the hard stumps of heather,
  we left them in full snore at sunrise on a clear morning, and
  ascended the hill dividing the waters that run into the Spey from
  those which feed the Dee. The dews lay heavy on the moss and heather,
  and, as we neared the top of the ridge, glittered brightly in the
  new-risen sun; while here and there the mists, forming themselves
  into round balls, gradually rolled up the sides of the hills, and,
  mounting like balloons, disappeared in the blue sky. As we passed
  down through the broken forest-land on the other side, we could see,
  on the top of the gentler elevations, the slender-branched horns of
  the red-deer between us and the sky. Even on our near approach the
  beautiful animals showed no signs of panic,&#8212;perhaps they knew
  our innocence; and they gazed idly as we passed, only tossing their
  heads in the air, and scampering off disdainfully when we approached
  offensively close. We reached the Dee by following the stream of the
  Quoich, which, like the Lui, passes through the remains of an ancient
  forest. It derives its convivial name from a peculiar cataract often
  visited by tourists from Braemar. Here the stone is hollowed by the
  action of the water into circular cavities like those of the Caldron
  Linn; and in one of these the guides will have the audacity to tell
  you that a bacchanalian party once made grog by tossing in a few
  ankers of brandy, and that they consumed the whole on the
  premises.</p>

  <p>We must now tell our pilgrim how he is to find his way by the more
  direct route from Loch Avon to Braemar, and we may at the same time
  afford a hint to the reader who desires to proceed towards the lake
  without crossing Ben Muich Dhui. Near where the stream of the Avon
  issues, it is necessary to turn to the right, and to keep rather
  ascending than descending. In a few miles the brow of the hill shuts
  us out from the wintry wild, and in a hollow are seen two small lakes
  called the Dhu Lochan, with nothing about them to attract notice but
  their dreariness and their blackness. The course of a burn which
  feeds them marks the way to the water-shier between the Spey and the
  Dee, whence a slight descent leads down to Glen Derrie, the position
  of which has been already described.</p>

  <p>We now propose another excursion&#8212;our last on the present
  occasion&#8212;to the sources of the Dee. We place <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>our
  wanderer again at the Linn of Dee. As he proceeds up the stream, the
  banks become flatter, and the valleys wider and less interesting,
  until after some miles&#8212;we really cannot say how many&#8212;the
  river turns somewhat northwards, and the banks become more close and
  rocky. At this spot there is a fine waterfall, which, in the midst of
  a desert, has contrived to surround itself with a not unbecoming
  clump of trees. The waters are divided into two; the Geusachan burn
  joining the stream from the west. At last the conical peak of Cairn
  Toul appears over-topping all the surrounding heights; and then, a
  rent intervening, we approach and soon walk under the great mural
  precipice of Brae Riach, which we have already surveyed to so much
  advantage from the top of Ben Muich Dhui. We are here in the spot
  which to us, of all this group of scenery, appears to be the most
  remarkable, as being so unlike any other part of Scotland, or any
  place we have seen elsewhere. The narrowness of the glen and the
  height of its walled sides are felt in the constrained attitude in
  which we look up on either side to the top, as if we were surveying
  some object of interest in a tenth story window of our own High
  Street. This same narrowness imparts a sensation as if one could not
  breathe freely. If we compare this defile to another of the grandest
  mountain passes in Scotland&#8212;to Glencoe, we find a marked
  difference between them. The scene of the great tragedy, grand and
  impressive as it is, has no such narrow walled defiles. The mountains
  are high, but they are of the sugar-loaf shape&#8212;abrupt, but
  never one mass of precipice from top to bottom. Cairn Toul resembles
  these hills, though it is considerably more precipitous: but Brae
  Riach is as unlike them as a tower is distinct from a dome. In this
  narrow glen we could tell of sunsets and sunrises, not accompanied by
  such disagreeable associations as those we have recorded in Glen
  Avon. Picture the very hottest day of a hot year. The journey in the
  wide burning glen up from the Linn of Dee has been accomplished only
  with the aid of sundry plunges in the deep, cold pools, which the
  stream has filled with water fresh from the inner chambers of the
  mountains. The moment we enter the narrow part of the glen, though
  the sun is still pretty far up in the heavens, we are in twilight
  gloom. We have no notice of his leaving the earth, save the gradual
  darkening of all things around us. Then the moon is up, but we have
  no further consciousness of his presence, save that the sharp peak of
  Cairn Toul shows its outline more clearly even than by daylight; and
  a lovely roof of light-blue, faintly studded with stars, contrasts
  with the dark sides of our rocky chamber. In such a time, when one
  has mounted so far above the level of the waters that they only make
  a distant murmur&#8212;when there is not a breath of wind stirring
  any thing&#8212;it is strange with how many mysterious voices the
  mountain yet speaks. Sometimes there is a monotonous and continuous
  rumble as if some huge stone, many miles off, were loosened from its
  position, and tumbling from rock to rock. Then comes a loud distinct
  report as if a rock had been split; and faint echoes of strange
  wailings touch the ear, as if this solemn desert were frequented at
  night by animals as little known to the inhabitants of our island as
  the uncouth wilds in which they live. But let not the wanderer
  indulge in thoughts of this description beyond the bounds of a
  pleasant imaginativeness. Let him take it for granted, that neither
  cayman nor rattlesnake will disturb his rest; and having pitched on a
  dry spot, let him pluck a large quantity of heather, making up a
  portion of it in bundles, and setting them on end closely packed
  together with the flower uppermost, while he reserves the rest to
  heap over himself. It is such a bed as a prince has seldom the good
  fortune to take his rest on; and if the wanderer have a good
  conscience, and the night be fine, he will sleep far more soundly
  than if he were packed on the floor of a bothy, with ten Highlanders
  who every now and then are giving their shoulders nervous jerks
  against the heather stumps, or scratching the very skin off their
  wrists. When he awakens, he finds himself nearer to the top of Ben
  Muich Dhui than he had probably supposed, and the ascent is straight
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg
  164]</a></span> and simple. He may be there to see the sun rise, a
  sight which has its own peculiar glories, though most people prefer
  seeing the event from some solitary hill, which, like Ben Nevis,
  Shehallion, or the Righi, stands alone, and looks round on a distant
  panorama of mountains.</p>

  <p>To return to the Dee.&#8212;The river divides again, one stream
  coming tumbling down through the cleft between Cairn Toul and Brae
  Riach, called the Garchary Burn. The other, less precipitously
  inclined, comes from between Brae Riach and Ben Mulch Dhul, and is
  called the Larig. Like the Nile and the Niger, the Dee is a river of
  a disputed source. As we shall presently find, the right of the
  Garchary to that distinction is strongly maintained by pretty high
  authority; but we are ourselves inclined to adopt the Larig, not only
  because it appeared to us to contain a greater volume of water, but
  because it is more in the line of the glen, and, though rough enough,
  is not so desperately flighty as the Garchary, and does not join it
  in those great leaps which, however surprising and worthy of
  admiration they may be in themselves, are not quite consistent with
  the calm dignity of a river destined to pass close to two
  universities. Following then the Larig over rocks and rough stones,
  among which it chafes and foams, we reach a sort of barrier of stones
  laid together by the hand of nature with the regularity of an
  artificial breakwater. As we pass over this barrier, a hollow
  rumbling is heard beneath; for the stream, at least at ordinary
  times, finds its way in many rills deep down among the stones. When
  we reach the top of the bank we are on the edge of a circular basin,
  abrupt and deep, but full of water so exquisitely clear that the
  pebbly bottom is every where visible. Here the various springs,
  passing by their own peculiar conduit-pipes from the centre of the
  mountain, meet together, and east up their waters into the round
  basin&#8212;one can see the surface disturbed by the force of their
  gushing. Soon after passing these &quot;wells of Dee,&quot; we are at
  the head of the pass of Cairngorm, and join the waters which run to
  the Spey. A path leads through the woods of Rothiemurchus to
  Aviemore, on which the nearest house is, or used to be, that of a
  widow named Mackenzie, who in that wide solitude extends her
  hospitality to the wayfarer. Blessings on her! may her stoup never be
  dry, or her aumry empty. It is needless to tell the traveller, that
  by this route he may approach the scenery of the Cairngorm hills from
  Laggan, Rannoch, and other places near Spey side.</p>

  <p>The claims of the Garchary to the leadership are supported by that
  respectable topographer Dr Skene Keith&#8212;probably on account of
  his own adventurous ascent of that turbulent stream, which we shall
  give in his own words, merely premising that we suspect he was
  mistaken in his discovery that the well he saw is called &quot;Well
  Dee.&quot;</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    &quot;At two o&#39;clock <span class='smcap'>p.m.</span> we set out
    to climb the mountain, still keeping in sight of the river. In a
    few minutes we came to the foot of a cataract, whose height we
    found to be one thousand feet, and which contained about a fourth
    part of the water of which the Garchary was now composed. In about
    half an hour after, we perceived that the cataract came from a lake
    in the ridge of the mountain of Cairn Toul, and that the summit of
    the mountain was another thousand feet above the loch, which is
    called Loch na Youn, or the Blue Lake. A short time after we saw
    the Dee (here called the Garchary from this rocky bed, which
    signifies in Gaelic <i>the rugged quarry</i>) tumbling in great
    majesty over the mountain down another cataract; or as we
    afterwards found it, a chain of natural cascades, above thirteen
    hundred feet high. It was in flood at this time from the melting of
    the snow, and the late rains; and what was most remarkable, an arch
    of snow covered the narrow glen from which it tumbled over the
    rocks. We approached so near to the cataract as to know that there
    was no other lake or stream; and then we had to climb among huge
    rocks, varying from one to ten tons, and to catch hold of the
    stones or fragments that projected, while we ascended in an angle
    of seventy or eighty degrees. A little before four o&#39;clock we
    got to the top of the mountain, which I knew <span class=
    'pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span> to
    be Brae Riach, or the speckled mountain. Here we found the highest
    well, which we afterwards learned was called Well Dee, and other
    five copious fountains, which make a considerable stream before
    they fall over the precipice. We sat down completely exhausted, at
    four o&#39;clock P.M. and drank of the highest well, which we found
    to be four thousand and sixty feet above the level of the sea; and
    whose fountain was only thirty-five degrees of heat on the 17th of
    July, or three degrees above the freezing point. We mixed some good
    whisky with this water, and recruited our strength [a very
    judicious proceeding.] Then we poured as a libation into the
    fountain a little of the excellent whisky which our landlord had
    brought along with him [a very foolish proceeding.] After resting
    half an hour, we ascended to the top of Brae Riach at five P.M.,
    and found it to be four thousand two hundred and eighty feet above
    the level of the sea.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id=

  <p>We must not bid farewell to this mountain desert without asking
  attention to a peculiar feature in the hills connected with a
  disastrous history. In many places the declivities are seamed with
  trenches some forty or fifty feet deep, appearing as if they were
  made by a gigantic plough-share which, instead of sand, casts up huge
  masses of rock on either side, in parallel mounds, like the morains
  of a glacier. There are many of these furrows on the side of Ben
  Muich Dhui, nearest to the Dee. Though we had long noticed them, it
  was not until we happened to be in that district, immediately after
  the great floods of 1829, that we were forcibly told of the peculiar
  cause of this appearance. The old furrows were as they had been
  before&#8212;the stones, gray, weather-beaten, and covered with
  lichen, while heather and wildflowers grew in the interstices. But
  among them were new scaurs, still like fresh wounds, with the stones
  showing the sharpness of late fracture, and no herbage covering the
  blood-red colour of the sand. It was clear from the venerable
  appearance of the older scaurs, that only at long intervals do the
  elements produce this formidable effect&#8212;at least many years had
  passed since the last instance before 1829 had occurred. The theory
  of the phenomenon appeared to be pretty simple. Each spring is a sort
  of stone cistern, which, through its peculiar duct, sends forth to
  one part of the surface of the earth the water it receives from
  another. If, through inordinately heavy falls of rain, there be a
  great volume of water pressing on the entrance tubes, the expansive
  force of the water in the cistern increases in that accumulating
  ratio which is practically exemplified in the hydraulic press, and
  the whole mass of water bursts forth from the side of the mountain,
  as if it were a staved barrel, rending rocks, and scattering their
  shattered fragments around like dust. Hence we may presume arose
  these fierce pulsations which made the rivers descend wave on wave.
  What a sight, to have been remembered and thought on ever after,
  would it have been, had one been present in this workshop of the
  storm while the work was going on!</p>

  <p>Now, reader, before we have done, let us confess that there are
  many elements that we like to meet with in such things, wherein this
  little contribution to the knowledge of British local scenery is
  deficient. Fain would we have given it a more hospitable tone,
  telling of the excellent cookery at this inn, and the good wines at
  the next, and the general civility experienced at the third; but we
  cast ourselves, O generous reader! on your mercy. How could we
  describe the comforts and luxuries of inns, in a place where there is
  not a single house&#8212;a place which, like the Irish milestone, is
  &quot;fifteen miles from inny where&quot;?</p>

  <p>As to the frequented methods of approach towards the border of the
  wilderness which we have taken under our especial patronage, we
  profess not to discuss them, leaving the public in the very competent
  hands of the Messrs Anderson, whose &quot;Guide to the Highlands and
  Islands of Scotland&quot; is, in relation to the inhabited districts,
  and the usual tourists&#39; routes, all-sufficient for its
  purpose.</p>

  <h3>LETTER VII&#8212;OBJECTS TO BE GAINED THROUGH THE ARTIFICIAL
  INDUCTION OF TRANCE.</h3>

  <p>DEAR ARCHY,&#8212;I am tempted to write you a letter more than I
  had originally intended,&#8212;a supplementary and final one.</p>

  <p>The powers which we have seen employed to shake the nerves and
  unsettle the mind in the service of superstition,&#8212;can they be
  turned to no useful purpose?</p>

  <p>To answer this question, I will give you a brief account of the
  two most vigorous attempts which have been made to turn the elements
  we have been considering to a profitable end. I have in my thoughts
  the invention of ether-inhalation and the induction of trance in
  mesmerism. The witch narcotised her pupils in order to produce in
  them delusive visions; the surgeon stupifies his patient to prevent
  the pain of an operation being felt. The fanatic preacher excites
  convulsions and trance in his auditory to persuade them that they are
  visited by the Holy Spirit; Mesmer produced the same effects as a
  means of curing disease.</p>

  <p>Let us first look into the simpler problem of
  ether-inhalation.</p>

  <p>It occurred to Mr Jackson, a chemist in the United States, that it
  might be possible, and unattended with risk, so to stupify a patient
  with the vapour of sulphuric ether that he might undergo a surgical
  operation without suffering. He communicated the idea to Mr Morton, a
  dentist, who carried it into execution with the happiest results. The
  patient became unconscious,&#8212;a tooth was extracted;&#8212;no
  sign of pain escaped at the time;&#8212;there was no recollection of
  suffering afterwards. Led by the report of this success, in the
  course of the autumn of 1846, Messrs Bigelow, Warren, and Heywood
  ventured to employ the same means in surgical operations of a more
  serious description. The results obtained on these occasions were not
  less satisfactory than the first had been. Since then, in England,
  France, and Germany, this interesting experiment has been repeated in
  numberless cases, and its general success may be considered to be
  established.</p>

  <p>The effects produced by the inhalation of the vapour of sulphuric
  ether, present a superficial resemblance to those produced by
  exposure to carbonic acid; but they are more closely analogous to the
  effects of inhaling nitrous oxide; and they may be compared and
  contrasted with those of opium and alcoholic liquors. But the patient
  is neither in the state of asphyxia, nor is he narcotised, nor drunk.
  The effects produced are peculiar, and deserve a name of their
  own.</p>

  <p>To give you a distinct idea of the ordinary phenomena of
  etherisation, I will cite three or four instances from a report on
  this subject by Dr Heyfelder, Knight, professor of medicine, and
  director of the surgical clinic at Erlangen.</p>

  <p>Dr Heyfelder himself, a strong and healthy man, after inhaling the
  vapour of ether for a minute, experienced an agreeable warmth in his
  whole person; after the second minute, he felt a disposition to
  cough, and diminution of ordinary sensibility. Then an impression
  supervened that some great change was about to take place within him.
  At the expiration of the third minute, he <i>lost sensibility and
  consciousness</i>. In this state he remained two minutes. The pulse
  was unaffected. Upon coming to himself, he felt a general sense of
  exhaustion, with weakness of the back and knees. For the remainder of
  the day he walked unsteadily, and his mind was confused.</p>

  <p>A. T., aged thirty-six, a tall strong servant-maid, after inhaling
  for seventeen minutes, became unconscious, and appeared not to feel a
  trifling wound with a surgical needle. In a minute <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg
  167]</a></span>consciousness returned. She laughed immoderately,
  spoke of an agreeable feeling of warmth, and said she had had
  pleasant dreams. The pulse was slower, the breathing deeper, during
  the inhalation. The same person upon inhaling, on another occasion,
  with a better apparatus, became insensible after two minutes. The
  eyes appeared red and suffused; a carious tooth was then extracted,
  which caused her to moan slightly. On returning to herself she
  complained of giddiness, but said she had experienced none but
  agreeable feelings. She had no idea that the tooth had been
  extracted.</p>

  <p>K. A., aged twenty-nine, upon beginning the inhalation, showed
  signs of excitement, but in nine minutes lay relaxed like a corpse. A
  tooth was extracted. Two minutes afterwards she awoke, moaning and
  disturbed. She stated that she <i>had not felt the extraction of the
  tooth, but she had heard it</i>.</p>

  <p>C. S., aged twenty-two, a strong and healthy young man, a student
  of surgery, on commencing the inhalation, coughed, and there was a
  flow of saliva and of tears. In three and a half minutes the skin
  appeared insensible to pain. Consciousness remained perfect and
  undisturbed. The skin was warm; the eyes were open; the hearing as
  usual; the speech, however, was difficult. This state continued
  eighteen minutes, during which, at <i>his request</i>, two teeth with
  large fangs were extracted. He held himself perfectly still. He said,
  afterwards, that <i>he felt the application of the instrument, but
  was sensible of no pain</i>, during the extraction of the teeth.</p>

  <p>W. S., aged nineteen, a strong and healthy young man, a
  law-student, after inhaling the ether-vapour a minute, began to move
  his arms about, struck his knees, stamped with his feet, laughed. In
  three minutes the laughter and excitement had increased. The eyes
  rolled, he sprang up, talked volubly; the pulse was strong and
  frequent. In seven minutes he breathed deeply, the eyelids closed,
  the pulse sank. In eight minutes he began to snore, but heard when
  called to. In nine minutes the eyes were suffused; the optic axes
  were directed upwards and outwards. At the end of twelve minutes a
  tooth was extracted, when he uttered an exclamation and laughed. On
  his return to himself, he said that he had <i>felt the laceration, or
  tear, but had experienced no pain</i>. He thought he had been at a
  carousal.</p>

  <p>If I add to these sketches that the patient sometimes becomes
  pale, sometimes flushed,&#8212;that the pupils of the eyes are
  generally dilated and fixed, sometimes natural and fixed, sometimes
  contracted,&#8212;that violent excitement sometimes manifests itself
  attended with the persistence or even exaltation of the ordinary
  sensibility,&#8212;that sometimes hysteric fits are brought on;
  sometimes a state resembling common intoxication,&#8212;you will have
  had the means of forming a sufficiently exact and comprehensive idea
  of the features of etherisation.</p>

  <p>Then, if we exclude the cases in which excitement, instead of
  collapse, is induced, and, in general, cases complicated with
  disorder of the head or chest, it appears that the inhalation of
  ether is not attended with questionable or injurious consequences;
  and that it places the patient in a condition in which the
  performance of a surgical operation may be prudently contemplated. If
  the operation require any length of time,&#8212;from thirty to forty
  minutes, for instance,&#8212;the state of insensibility may be safely
  maintained, by causing the inhalation to be resumed as often as its
  effects begin to wear off. In minor cases of surgery, in which union
  of the wound <i>by adhesion</i> is necessary to the success of the
  operation&#8212;in harelip, for instance&#8212;an exacter comparison
  is, perhaps, requisite than has yet been made of the relative results
  obtained on etherised and non-etherised patients. In graver cases,
  some of which always end fatally, symptoms, again, may occasionally
  supervene, or continue from the time of the operation, which are
  directly attributable to the etherisation. But, in all probability,
  the entire proportion of recoveries in etherised cases will be found
  to be increased, through the injurious effects being averted which
  are produced by fear and suffering. There is every reason to expect
  that a saving of human life will be thus realised,&#8212;an
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg
  168]</a></span>advantage over and above the deliverance from pain and
  terror.</p>

  <p>So the invention of etherisation deserves to be rated as a signal
  benefit to humanity. Nor is it to be lost sight of, that the
  invention is quite in its infancy; and that any sound objections
  which may, at present, be raised against it, are not unlikely to be
  obviated through the modifications and improvements of which it is no
  doubt susceptible. The amount of success already obtained, may
  further be deemed sufficient to make us secure that the object of
  extinguishing the sufferings of surgery will never <i>again</i> be
  lost sight of by the medical profession and the public. One item,
  partial indeed, but a tolerably severe one, in the catalogue of the
  physical ills to which flesh is heir, is thus so far in a fair way of
  being got rid of.</p>

  <p>The method of Mesmer was an attempt to cure bodily disease by
  making a forcible impression on the nerves. And no doubt can be
  entertained that many of his patients were the better for the violent
  succussion of the system which his developed practice put them
  through.</p>

  <p>But mesmerism contained two things,&#8212;a bold empirical
  practice and a mystical theory. Mesmer strove, by the latter, to
  explain the effects which his practice produced. An odd fate his
  method and his theory will have had. His method was considered, by
  many of his contemporaries, as of solid importance; his theory was
  for the most part ridiculed as that of a half-crazed enthusiast and
  impostor. Now, no reasonable person can regard his practice in any
  other light than as a rough and hazardous experiment. But his theory,
  in the mean time, is ceasing to be absurd; for it admits of being
  represented as a very respectable anticipation of Von
  Reichenbach&#39;s recent discoveries.</p>

  <p>Mesmer, a native of Switzerland, was born in 1734. He became a
  student at Vienna, where his turn for the mystical led him to the
  studies of alchemy and astrology. In the year 1766, he published a
  treatise on the influence of the planets upon the human frame. It
  contains the idea that a force extends throughout space through which
  the stars can affect the body. In attempting to identify this force,
  Mesmer first supposed it to be electricity. Afterwards, about the
  year 1773, he adopted the belief that it must be ordinary magnetism.
  So at Vienna, from 1773 to 1775, he employed the practice of stroking
  diseased parts of the body with magnets. But, in 1776, making a tour
  in Bavaria and Switzerland, he fell in with the notorious Father
  Gassner, who had at that time undertaken the cure of the blind
  prince-bishop of Ratisbon by exorcism. Then Mesmer observed that,
  without employing magnets, Gassner obtained very much the same kind
  of effects upon the human body which he had produced with their aid.
  The fact was not lost upon him. He threw away his magnets, and
  henceforth operated with the hand alone. In 1777, his reputation a
  little damaged by a failure in the case of the musician Paradies,
  Mesmer left Vienna, and the following year betook himself to Paris.
  The great success which he obtained there drew upon him the
  indignation and jealousy of the faculty, who did not scruple to brand
  him with the stigma of charlatanism. They averred that he threw
  difficulties in the way of a satisfactory examination of his method;
  but perhaps he had reason to suspect want of fairness in the proposed
  inquiry. He refused, from the government, an offer of twenty thousand
  francs to divulge his method; but he was ready to explain it, it is
  true, under a pledge of secresy, to individuals for one hundred
  louis. But his practice itself gave most support to the allegations
  against him. His patients were received and treated with an air of
  mystery and studied effect. The apartment, hung on every side with
  mirrors, was dimly lighted. A profound silence was observed, broken
  only by strains of music, which occasionally floated through the
  rooms. The patients were arranged around a large vessel, which
  contained a heterogeneous mixture of chemical ingredients. With this
  and with each other, they were placed in relation, by holding cords
  or jointed rods; and among them moved slowly and mysteriously Mesmer
  himself, affecting one by a touch, another by a look, a third by
  continued stroking with the hand, a fourth by pointing at him with a
  rod.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg
  169]</a></span></p>

  <p>What followed is easily conceivable from the scenes referred to in
  my last letter, which are witnessed at religious revivals. One person
  became hysterical, then another; one was seized with catalepsy, then
  others; some with convulsions; some with palpitations of the heart,
  perspirations, and other bodily disturbances. These effects, however
  various and different, went all by the name of &quot;salutary
  crises.&quot; The method was supposed to produce, in the sick person,
  exactly the kind of action propitious to his recovery. And it may
  easily be imagined that many patients found themselves better after a
  course of this rude empiricism; and that the impression made by these
  events, passing daily in Paris, must have been very considerable. To
  the ignorant the scene was full of wonderment.</p>

  <p>To ourselves, regarding it from our present vantage-ground, it
  contains absolutely nothing of the marvellous. We discern the means
  which were in operation, and which are theoretically sufficient to
  produce the result. Those means consisted in,&#8212;first,
  high-wrought expectation and excited fancy, enough alone to set some
  of the most excitable into fits;&#8212;secondly, the contagious power
  of nervous disorder to cause the like disorder in others, a power
  augmenting with the number of persons infected;&#8212;thirdly, the
  physical influence upon the body of the <i>Od force</i> discovered by
  Von Reichenbach, which is produced in abundance by chemical
  decomposition, which can be communicated to, and conveyed by
  inanimate conductors, and which finally emanates with great vivacity
  from the subtle chemistry of the living human frame itself. The
  reality of this third cause you must allow me to take for granted
  without farther explanation. Von Reichenbach&#39;s papers, the credit
  of which is guaranteed by their publication in Liebig and
  WÃ¶hler&#39;s Annals of Chemistry, have been now some time translated
  into English, and are in the hands of most English readers.</p>

  <p>It is remarkable that Jussieu, the most competent judge in the
  commission which, in 1784 condemned mesmerism as a scientific
  imposition, was so much struck with the effects he witnessed, that he
  recommended the subject, nevertheless, to the farther investigation
  of medical men. His objections were to the theory. He laid it down,
  in the separate report which he made, that the only physical cause in
  operation was animal heat; curiously overlooking the point, that
  common heat was not capable of doing the same things, and that,
  therefore, the effects <i>must be owing to the agency of that
  something else</i> which animal heat contained in addition to common
  heat.</p>

  <p>It is unnecessary to follow Mesmer through his minor performances.
  The relief sometimes obtained by stroking diseased parts with the
  hand had before been proclaimed by Dr Greatorex, whose pretensions
  had no less an advocate than the Honourable Robert Boyle. The
  extraordinary tales of Mesmer&#39;s immediate and instantaneous
  personal power over individuals are probably part exaggeration, part
  the real result of his confidence and practice in the use of the
  means he wielded. Mesmer died in 1815.</p>

  <p>Among his pupils, when at the zenith of his fame, was the Marquis
  de PuysÃ©gur. Returning from serving at the siege of Gibraltar, this
  young officer found mesmerism the mode at Paris, and appears to have
  become, for no other reason, one of the initiated. At the end of the
  course of instruction, he professed himself to be no wiser than when
  he began; and he ridiculed the credulity and the faith of his
  brothers, who were stanch adherents of the new doctrine. However he
  did not forget his lesson; and on going, the same spring, to his
  estate at Basancy, near Soissons, he took occasion to mesmerise the
  daughter of his agent, and another young person, for the toothach,
  who declared themselves, in a few minutes, cured. This questionable
  success was sufficient to lead M. de PuysÃ©gur, a few days after, to
  try his hand on a young peasant of the name of Victor, who was
  suffering with a severe fluxion upon the chest. What was M. de
  PuysÃ©gur&#39;s surprise when, at the end of a few minutes, Victor
  went off into a kind of tranquil sleep, without crisis or convulsion,
  and in that sleep began to gesticulate, and talk, and enter into his
  private affairs. Then he became sad; and M. de PuysÃ©gur tried
  mentally to inspire him with cheerful <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span> thoughts; he hummed a
  lively tune to himself, <i>inaudibly</i>, and immediately Victor
  began to sing the air. Victor remained asleep for an hour, and awoke
  composed, with his symptoms mitigated.</p>

  <p>The case of Victor revolutionised the art of mesmerism. The large
  part of his life in which M. PuysÃ©gur had nothing to do but to follow
  this vein of inquiry, was occupied in practising and advocating a
  gentle manipulation to induce sleep, in preference to the more
  violent crises. I have no plea for telling you how M. de PuysÃ©gur
  served in the first French revolutionary armies; how he quitted the
  service in disgust; how narrowly he escaped the guillotine; how he
  lived in retirement afterwards, benevolently endeavouring to do good
  to his sick neighbours by mesmerism; how he survived the Restoration;
  and how, finally, he died of a cold caught by serving again in the
  encampment at Rheims to assist as an old <i>militaire</i> at the
  <i>sacre</i> of Charles X.</p>

  <p>For he had, to use the phrase of the moment, fulfilled his mission
  the day that he put Victor to sleep. He had made a vast stride in
  advance of his teacher. Not but that Mesmer must frequently have
  produced the same effect, but <i>he</i> had passed it over unheeded,
  as one only of the numerous forms of salutary crisis; nor that M. de
  PuysÃ©gur himself estimated, or that the knowledge had then been
  brought together which would have enabled him to estimate, the value,
  or the real nature and meaning, of the step which he had made. To
  himself he appeared to be largely extending the domain of mesmerism,
  of which he had, in truth, discovered and gone beyond the limits.</p>

  <p>The state which he had so promptly and fortunately induced in
  Victor, was <i>neither more nor less than common trance</i>&#8212;the
  commonest form, perhaps, of the great family of nervous disorders, to
  which ordinary sleep-walking belongs, and of which I have already
  sketched the divisions and relations in the fifth letter of this
  series. All that remains, combining originality and value, of
  Mesmer&#39;s art, is, that it furnishes the surest method of inducing
  this particular condition of the system. Employed with collateral
  means calculated to shake the nerves and excite the imagination,
  mesmerism causes the same variety of convulsive and violent seizures
  which extremes of fanatical frenzy excite; when it is employed in a
  gentle form and manner, with accessaries that only soothe and
  tranquillise, the most plain and unpretending form of trance quietly
  steps upon the scene.</p>

  <p>Perhaps you will wonder that I seem to attach so much importance
  to the power which mesmerism offers us, of producing at pleasure mere
  ordinary trance; and, unluckily, it is easy to overrate that
  importance; because, for any plan we are yet in possession of, the
  induction of trance, through mesmerism, is, in truth, a very
  uncertain and capricious affair. It is but a limited number of
  persons who can be affected by mesmerism; and the good to be obtained
  from the process is proportionately limited.</p>

  <p>The first object to which artificial induction of trance may be
  turned, is the cure or alleviation of certain forms of disease.</p>

  <p>It has been mentioned that in many so-called cataleptic cases, a
  condition of violent spasm is constantly present, <i>except</i> when
  the patient falls into an alternative state of trance. <i>The
  spontaneous supervention of trance relieves the spasm.</i></p>

  <p>I mentioned, too, in the fifth letter of this series, the case of
  Henry Engelbrecht, who, after a life of asceticism, and a week of
  nearly total abstinence, fell into a death-trance. <i>On waking from
  it, he felt refreshed and stronger.</i></p>

  <p>These results are quite intelligible. In trance, the nervous
  system is put <i>out of gear</i>. The strain of its functions is
  suspended. Now, perhaps for the first time since birth, the nervous
  system, a part or the whole, experiences entire repose. The effect of
  this must be as soothing to it, as is to a diseased joint the
  disposing it in a relaxed position on a pillow. In this state of
  profound rest, it is natural that the nervous system should recruit
  its forces; that if previously weak and irritable, it should emerge
  from the trance stronger and more composed; that the induction of
  trance many days repeated, and maintained daily an hour or more,
  should finally enable the nerves to recover any extent of mere loss
  of tone, with its dependent morbid excitability, and to <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span> shake
  off various forms of disorder dependent upon that cause. So might it
  be expected, that epilepsy, that hysteric and cataleptic fits, that
  nervous palsy, that tic-doloreux, when caused by no structural
  impairment of organ, should get weak under the use of this
  means&#8212;other means, of course, not being thereby excluded, which
  peculiar features of individual cases render advisable. And
  experience justifies this reasonable anticipation. And it is found
  practically that, for purely nervous disorders, the artificial
  induction of trance is, generally speaking, the most efficient
  remedy. Nay, in cases of a more serious complexion, where organic
  disease exists, some unnecessary suffering and superfluous nervous
  irritability may be thus allayed and discarded. Even more may be said
  in favour of the availability of this practice. There are few
  diseases of any kind, and of other parts, in which the nervous system
  does not, primarily or secondarily, become implicated. And so far
  does disease in general contain an element which often may be reached
  and modified with salutary effect, through the means I am now
  advocating. When the prejudices of medical men against the artificial
  induction of trance have subsided, and its sanative agency has been
  fairly tried, and diligently studied, there is no doubt it will take
  a high rank among the resources of medicine.</p>

  <p>In surgery, artificial trance is capable of playing a not less
  important part than in medicine.</p>

  <p>For, as it has been already mentioned, an ordinary feature of
  trance is the entire suspension of common feeling. As long as the
  trance is maintained, the patient is impassive to all common
  impressions on the touch; the smartest electric shock, a feather
  introduced into the nose, burning, or cutting with a knife, excite no
  sensation. So that surgical operations may be performed without
  suffering during trance just as in the stupor produced by the ether
  inhalation. Then, as trance soothes the nerves, the patient, over and
  above the extinction of pain, is in a fitter state than otherwise for
  the infliction of physical violence. Likewise the trance may be
  induced not only at the time of the operation, but with equal safety
  on all the subsequent occasions when the wound has to be disturbed
  and dressed,&#8212;so that, in addition, all the after suffering
  attendant upon great operations may be thus avoided. The drawback
  against the method, is the uncertainty there exists of being able to
  induce trance artificially in any given case. But the trial is always
  worth making; and the number who can, with a little patience, be put
  thus as it were to sleep, is undoubtedly greater than is
  imagined.</p>

  <p>The most celebrated case in which an operation has been performed
  upon a patient in the state of artificial trance, is that of Madame
  Plantin. She was sixty-four years of age, and laboured under scirrhus
  of the breast. She was prepared for the operation by M. ChapÃ©lain,
  who on several successive days threw her into trance by the ordinary
  mesmeric manipulations. She was <i>then</i> like an ordinary
  sleep-walker, and would converse with indifference about the
  contemplated operation, the idea of which, when she was in her
  natural state, filled her with terror. The operation of removing the
  diseased breast was performed at Paris on the 12th of April 1829, by
  M. Jules Cloquet: it lasted from ten to twelve minutes. During the
  whole of this time, the patient <i>in her trance</i> conversed calmly
  with M. Cloquet, and exhibited not the slightest sign of suffering.
  Her expression of countenance did not change, nor were the voice, the
  breathing, or the pulse, at all affected. After the wound was
  dressed, the patient was awakened from the trance, when, on learning
  that the operation was over, and seeing her children round her,
  Madame Plantin was affected with considerable emotion: whereupon M.
  ChapÃ©lain, to compose her, put her back into the state of trance.</p>

  <p>I copy the above particulars from Dr Foissac&#39;s
  &quot;<i>Rapports et Discussions de l&#39;Academie Royale de Medicine
  sur le Magnetisme Animal</i>.&quot;&#8212;Paris, 1833. &quot;My
  friend, Dr Warren of Boston, informed me that, being at Paris, he had
  asked M. Jules Cloquet if the story were true. M. Cloquet answered,
  &quot;Perfectly.&quot; &quot;Then why,&quot; said Dr Warren,
  &quot;have you not repeated the practice?&quot; M. Cloquet replied,
  &quot;that he had not dared: that the pre <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span> judice
  against mesmerism was so strong at Paris, that he probably would have
  lost his reputation and his income by so doing.&quot;</p>

  <p>Here, then, we discover two purposes of partial, indeed, but
  signal utility, compassable by the induction of trance, at the very
  outset of our inquiry into its utility. It will appear by-and-by that
  this resource promises to afford yet farther assistance to the
  physician. In the mean time, let us look at a relation of the subject
  which may appear more interesting to the general reader.</p>

  <p>It has been mentioned that, in ordinary trance, the relations of
  consciousness to the nervous system are altered; that the laws of
  sensation and perception are suspended, or temporarily changed; that
  the mind appears to gain new powers. For a long time we had to trust
  to the chance turning up of cases of spontaneous trance, in the
  experience of physicians of observation, for any light we could hope
  would be thrown on those extraordinary phenomena. Now we possess
  around us, on every side, adequate opportunities for completely
  elucidating these events, if we please to employ them. The
  philosopher, when his speculations suggest a new question to be put,
  can summon the attendance of a trance, as easily as the Jupiter of
  the Iliad summoned a dream. Or, looking out for two or three cases to
  which the induction of trance may be beneficial, the physician may
  have in his house subjects for perpetual reference and daily
  experiment.</p>

  <p>A gentleman with whom I have long been well acquainted, for many
  years Chairman of the Quarter Sessions in a northern county, of which
  the last year he was High Sheriff, has, like M. de PuysÃ©gur, amused
  some of his leisure hours, and benevolently done not a little good,
  by taking the trouble of mesmerising invalids, whom he has thus
  restored to health. In constant correspondence with, and occasionally
  having the pleasure of seeing this gentleman, I have learned from him
  the common course in which the new powers of the mind which belong to
  trance are developed under its artificial induction. The sketch which
  I propose to give of this subject will be taken on his descriptions,
  which, I should observe, tally in all essential points with what I
  meet with in French and German authors. The little that I have myself
  seen of the matter, I will mention preliminarily; the most astounding
  things, it appears to me safer to shelter under the authority of
  Petetin, who, towards the close of the last century, <i>in ignorance
  of mesmerism</i>, described these phenomena <i>as they came before
  him spontaneously in catalepsy</i>.</p>

  <p>The method of inducing trance that is found to be most successful,
  is to sit immediately fronting, and close to the patient, holding his
  hands or thumbs, or pointing the extended hands towards his forehead,
  and slowly moving them in passes down his face, shoulders, and arms.
  It is now clear that the force brought into operation on this
  occasion, is the Od force of Von Reichenbach. So the patients
  sometimes speak of seeing the luminous aura proceeding from the
  finger-points of the operator, which Von Reichenbach&#39;s performers
  described. There are many who are utterly insensible to this agency.
  Others are sensible of it in slight, and in various ways. A small
  proportion, three in ten perhaps, are susceptible to the extent of
  being thrown into trance.</p>

  <p>In some, a common fit of hysterics is produced. In others, slight
  headach, and a sense of weight on the eyebrows, and difficulty of
  raising the eyelids supervene.</p>

  <p>In one young woman, whom I saw mesmerized for the first time by
  Dupotel, nothing resulted but a sense of pricking and tingling
  wherever he pointed with his hand; and her arm on one or two
  occasions jumped in the most natural and conclusive manner, when, her
  eyes being covered, he directed his outstretched finger to it.</p>

  <p>A gentleman, about thirty years of age, when the mesmerizer held
  his outstretched hands pointed to his head, experienced no
  disposition to sleep; but in two or three minutes, he began to shake
  his head and twist his features about; at last, his head was jerked
  from side to side, and forwards and backwards, with a violence that
  looked alarming. But he said, when it was over, that the motion had
  not been unpleasant; that he had moved in a sort voluntarily;
  although he <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id=
  "Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span> could not refrain from it. If the
  hands of the operator were pointed to his arm instead of his head,
  the same violent jerks came in it, and gradually extended to the
  whole body. I asked him to try to resist the influence, by holding
  his arm out in strong muscular tension. This had the effect of
  retarding the attack of the jerks, but, when it came on, it was more
  violent than usual.</p>

  <p>A servant of mine, aged about twenty-five, was mesmerized by
  Lafontaine, for a full half hour, and, no effect appearing to be
  produced, I told him he might rise from the chair, and leave us. On
  getting up, he looked uneasy and said his arms wore numb. They were
  perfectly paralysed from the elbows downwards, and numb to the
  shoulders. This was the more satisfactory, that neither the man
  himself, nor Lafontaine, nor the four or five spectators, expected
  this result. The operator triumphantly drew a pin and stuck-it into
  the man&#39;s hand, which bled but had no feeling. Then heedlessly,
  to show it gave pain, Lafontaine stuck the pin into the man&#39;s
  thigh, whose flashing eye, and half suppressed growl, denoted that
  the aggression would certainly have been returned by another, had the
  arm which should have done it not been really powerless. However, M.
  Lafontaine made peace with the man, by restoring him the use and
  feeling of his arms. This was done by dusting them, as it were, by
  quick transverse motions of his extended hands. In five minutes
  nothing remained of the palsy but a slight stiffness, which gradually
  wore off in the course of the evening.</p>

  <p>Genuine and ordinary trance, I have seen produced by the same
  manipulations in from three minutes, to half an hour. The
  patient&#39;s eyelids have dropped, he has appeared on the point of
  sleeping, but he has not sunk back upon his chair; then he has
  continued to sit upright, and seemingly perfectly insensible to the
  loudest sound or the acutest and most startling impressions on the
  sense of touch. The pulse is commonly a little increased in
  frequency; the breathing is sometimes heavier than usual.</p>

  <p>Occasionally, as in Victor&#39;s case, the patient quickly and
  spontaneously emerges from the state of trance-sleep into trance
  half-waking; a rapidity of development which I am persuaded occurs
  much more frequently among the French than with the English or
  Germans. English patients, especially, for the most part require a
  long course of education, many sittings, to have the same powers
  drawn out. And these are by far the most interesting cases. I will
  describe from Mr Williamson&#39;s account, the course he has usually
  followed in developing his patient&#39;s powers, and the order in
  which they have manifested themselves.</p>

  <p>On the first day, perhaps, nothing can be elicited. But after some
  minutes the stupor seems as it were less embarrassing to the patient,
  who appears less heavily slumbrous, and breathes lighter again; or it
  may be the reverse, particularly if the patient is epileptic; after a
  little, the breathing may be deeper, the state one of less composure.
  Pointing with the hands to the pit of the stomach, laying the hands
  upon the shoulders, and slowly moving them on the arms down to the
  hands, the whole with the utmost quietude and composure on the part
  of the operator, will dispel the oppression.</p>

  <p>And the interest of the first sitting is confined to the process
  of awakening the patient, which is one of the most marvellous
  phenomena of the whole. The operator lays his two thumbs on the space
  between the eyebrows, and as it were vigorously smooths or irons his
  eyebrows, rubbing them from within, outwards seven or eight times.
  Upon this, the patient probably raises his head and his eyebrows, and
  draws a deeper breath as if he would yawn; he is half awake, and
  blowing upon the eyelids, or the repetition of the previous
  operation, or dusting the forehead by smart transverse wavings of the
  hand, or blowing upon it, causes the patient&#39;s countenance to
  become animated; the eyelids open, he looks about him, recognises
  you, and begins to speak. If any feeling of heaviness remains, any
  weight or pain of the forehead, another repetition of the same
  manipulations sets all right. And yet this patient would not have
  been awakened, if a gun had been fired at his ear, or his arm had
  been cut off.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id=
  "Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

  <p>At the next sitting, or the next to that, the living statue begins
  to wake in its tranced life. The operator holds one hand over the
  opposite hand of his patient, and makes as if he would draw the
  patient&#39;s hand upwards, raising his own with short successive
  jerks, yet not too abrupt. Then the patient&#39;s hand begins to
  follow his; and often having ascended some inches, stops in the air
  cataleptic. This fixed state is always relieved by transverse
  brushings with the hand, or by breathing in addition, on the rigid
  limb. And it is most curious to see the whole bodily frame, over
  which spasmodic rigidness may have crept, thus thawed joint by joint.
  Then the first effect shown commonly is this motion, the
  patient&#39;s hand following the operator&#39;s. At the same sitting,
  he begins to hear, and there is intelligence in his countenance, when
  the operator pronounces his name: perhaps his lips move, and he
  begins to answer pertinently as in ordinary sleep-walking. But he
  hears the operator alone best, and him even in a whisper. <i>Your</i>
  voice, if you shout, he does not hear: unless you take the
  operator&#39;s hand, and then he hears <i>you</i> too. In general,
  however, now the proximity of others seems in some way to be sensible
  to him; and he appears uneasy when they crowd close upon him. It
  seems that the force of the relation between the operator and his
  patient naturally goes on increasing, as the powers of the
  sleep-walker are developed; but that this is not necessarily the
  case, and depends upon its being encouraged by much commerce between
  them, and the exclusion of others from joining in this
  trance-communion.</p>

  <p>And now the patient&#8212;beginning to wake in trance, hearing and
  answering the questions of the operator, moving each limb, or rising
  even, as the operator&#39;s hand is raised to draw him into obedient
  following&#8212;enters into a new relation with his mesmeriser. He
  <i>adopts sympathetically every voluntary movement of the other</i>.
  When the latter rises from his chair, <i>he</i> rises; when he sits
  down, <i>he</i> sits down; if he bows, <i>he</i> bows; if he make a
  grimace, <i>he</i> makes the same. Yet his eyes are closed. He
  certainly does not see. His mind has interpenetrated to a small
  extent the nervous system of the operator; and is in relation with
  his voluntary nerves and the anterior half of his cranio-spinal
  chord. (These are the organs by which the impulse to voluntary motion
  is conveyed and originated.) Farther into the other&#39;s being, he
  has not yet got. So he does not <i>what the other thinks of, or
  wishes him to do</i>; but only what the other either does, or goes
  through the mental part of doing. So Victor sang the air, which M. de
  PuysÃ©gur only mentally hummed.</p>

  <p>The next strange phenomenon marks that the mind of the untranced
  patient has interpenetrated the nervous system of the other <i>a step
  farther</i>, and is in relation besides with the posterior half of
  the cranio-spinal chord and its nerves. For now the entranced person,
  who has no feeling, or taste, or smell of his own, <i>feels, tastes,
  and smells every thing that is made to tell on the senses of the
  operator</i>. If mustard or sugar be put in his own mouth, he seems
  not to know that they are there; if mustard is placed on the tongue
  of the operator, the entranced person expresses great disgust, and
  tries as if to spit it out. The same with bodily pain. If you pluck a
  hair from the operator&#39;s head, the other complains of the pain
  you give <i>him</i>.</p>

  <p>To state in the closest way what has happened&#8212;the phenomena
  of sympathetic motion and sympathetic sensation, thus displayed, are
  exactly such as might be expected to follow, if the mind or conscious
  principle of the entranced person were brought into relation with the
  cranio-spinal chord of the operator and its nerves, and with no
  farther portion of his nervous system. Later, it will be seen the
  interpenetration can extend farther.</p>

  <p>But before this happens, a new phenomenon manifests itself, not of
  a sympathetic character. The operator contrives to wake the entranced
  person to the knowledge that he possesses new faculties. <i>He
  develops in him new organs of sensation</i>, or rather helps to
  hasten his recognition of their possession.</p>

  <p>It is to be observed, however, that many and many who can be
  thrown into trance will not progress so far as <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span> to the
  present step. Others make a tantalising half advance towards reaching
  it <i>thus</i>; and then stop. They are asked, &quot;Do you see any
  thing?&quot; After some days at length, they answer,
  &quot;Yes&quot;&#8212;&quot;What?&quot; &quot;A light.&quot;
  &quot;Where is the light?&quot; Then they intimate its place to be
  either before them, or at the crown of the head, or behind one ear,
  or quite behind the head. And they describe the colour of the light,
  which is commonly yellow. And each day it occupies the same
  direction, and is seen equally when the room is light or dark. Their
  eyes in the mean time are closed. And here, with many, the phenomenon
  stops.</p>

  <p>But, with others, it goes thus strangely farther. In this light
  they begin to discern objects, or they see whatever is presented to
  them in the direction in which the light lies, whether before the
  forehead or at the crown of the head, or wherever it may be.
  Sometimes the range of this new sense is very limited, and the object
  to be seen must be held near to the new organ. Sometimes it must
  touch it; generally, however, the sense commands what the eye would,
  if it were placed there.</p>

  <p>One tries first to escape the improbability of an extempore organ
  of sense being thus established, by supposing that the mind of the
  entranced person has only penetrated a little deeper than before into
  yours, and perceives what you see. But I had the following experiment
  made, which excludes this solution of the phenomenon. The party
  standing behind the entranced person, whose use it was to see with
  the back of her head, held behind him a pack of cards, and then,
  drawing one of them, presented it, without seeing it himself, to her
  new organ of vision. She named the card justly each time the
  experiment was repeated.</p>

  <p>The degree of light suiting this new vision varies in different
  cases: sometimes bright daylight is best; generally they prefer a
  moderate light. Some distinguish objects and colours in a light so
  obscure that the standers-by cannot distinguish the same with their
  eyes.</p>

  <p>The above phenomena have been, over and over again, verified by
  the gentleman whom I before referred to, Mr J. W. Williamson of
  Whickham; and not only have I received the accounts of them from
  himself, but from two other gentlemen, who repeatedly witnessed their
  manifestation in patients at Mr Williamson&#39;s residence.</p>

  <p>A parallel transposition of the sense of hearing I will exemplify
  from the details of a case of catalepsy, or spontaneous trance, as
  they are given by the observer, Dr Petetin, an eminent civil and
  military physician of Lyons, where he was president of the Medical
  Society. The work in which they are given is entitled, &quot;Memoire
  sur la Catalepsie. 1787.&quot;</p>

  <p>M. Petetin attended a young married lady in a sort of fit. She lay
  seemingly unconscious; when he raised her arm, it remained in the air
  where he placed it. Being put to bed, she commenced singing. To stop
  her, the doctor placed her limbs each in a different position. This
  embarrassed her considerably, but she went on singing. She seemed
  perfectly insensible. Pinching the skin, shouting in her ear, nothing
  aroused attention. Then it happened that, in arranging her, the
  doctor&#39;s foot slipped; and, as he recovered himself, half leaning
  over her, he said, &quot;how provoking we can&#39;t make her leave
  off singing!&quot; &quot;Ah, doctor,&quot; she cried, &quot;don&#39;t
  be angry! I won&#39;t sing any more,&quot; and she stopped. But
  shortly she began again; and in vain did the doctor implore her, by
  the loudest entreaties, addressed to her ear, to keep her promise and
  desist. It then occurred to him to place himself in the same position
  as when she heard him before. He raised the bed-clothes, bent his
  head towards her stomach, and said, in a loud voice, &quot;Do you,
  then, mean to sing forever?&quot; &quot;Oh, what pain you have given
  me!&quot; she exclaimed&#8212;&quot;I implore you speak lower;&quot;
  at the same time she passed her hand over the pit of her stomach.
  &quot;In what way, then, do you hear?&quot; said Dr Petetin.
  &quot;Like any one else,&quot; was the answer. &quot;But I am
  speaking to your stomach.&quot; &quot;Is it possible!&quot; she said.
  He then tried again whether she could hear with her ears, speaking
  even through a tube to aggravate his voice;&#8212;she heard nothing.
  On his asking her, at the pit of her stomach, if she had not heard
  him, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg
  176]</a></span> &#8212;&quot;No,&quot; said she, &quot;I am indeed
  unfortunate.&quot;</p>

  <p>A cognate phenomenon to the above is <i>the conversion of the
  patient&#39;s new sense of vision in a direction inwards</i>. He
  looks into himself, and sees his own inside as it were illuminated or
  transfigured.</p>

  <p>A few days after the scone just described, Dr Petetin&#39;s
  patient had another attack of catalepsy. She still heard at the pit
  of her stomach, but the manner of hearing was modified. In the mean
  time her countenance expressed astonishment. Dr Petetin inquired the
  cause. &quot;It is not difficult,&quot; she answered, &quot;to
  explain to you why I look astonished. I am singing, doctor, to divert
  my attention from a sight which appals me. I see my inside, and the
  strange forms of the organs, surrounded with a network of light. My
  countenance must express what I feel,&#8212;astonishment and fear. A
  physician who should have my complaint for a quarter of an hour would
  think himself fortunate, as nature would reveal all her secrets to
  him. If he was devoted to his profession, he would not, as I do,
  desire to be quickly well.&quot; &quot;Do you see your heart?&quot;
  asked Dr Petetin. &quot;Yes, there it is; it beats at twice; the two
  sides in agreement; when the upper part contracts, the lower part
  swells, and immediately after that contracts. The blood rushes out
  all luminous, and issues by two great vessels which are but a little
  apart.&quot;</p>

  <p>There are many cases like the above on record, perfectly attested.
  There is no escaping from the facts. We have no resource but to
  believe them. Things if possible still more marvellous remain behind.
  The more advanced patient penetrates the sensoria of those around
  her, and knows their thoughts and all the folds of their characters.
  She is able, farther, to perceive objects, directly, at
  considerable&#8212;indefinite distances. She can foresee coming
  events in her own health. Finally, she can feel and discern by a kind
  of intuition, what is the matter with another person either brought
  into her presence, or who is, in certain other ways, identified by
  her. As the evidence of the possession of these faculties by
  entranced persons is complete, and admits of no question, an
  important use, I repeat, of the artificial induction of trance is,
  that it will multiply occasions of sifting this extraordinary field
  of psychological inquiry.</p>

  <p>In the mean time I will not trespass upon your patience farther,
  nor weary you with farther instances, beyond giving the sequel of the
  case of catalepsy of which I have above mentioned some particulars.
  You will see in it a shadowing out of most of the other powers, which
  I have said are occasionally manifested by persons in trance, which
  sometimes attain an extraordinary vigour and compass, and which are
  maintained, or are maintainable, for several years, being manifested
  for that time, though not without caprice and occasional entire
  failures, on the patient reverting to the entranced condition. One of
  the most interesting features in what follows is, that it is evident
  M. Petetin was entirely unacquainted with mesmerism; and, at the same
  time, that he had all but discovered and developed the art of
  mesmeric manipulation himself.</p>

  <p>The following morning, (to give the latter part of the case of
  catalepsy,) the access of the fit took place, according to custom, at
  eight o&#39;clock in the morning. Petetin arrived later than usual;
  he announced himself by speaking to the fingers of the patient, (by
  which he was heard.) &quot;You are a very lazy person this morning,
  doctor,&quot; said she. &quot;It is true, madam; but if you knew the
  reason, you would not reproach me.&quot; &quot;Ah,&quot; said she,
  &quot;I perceive, you have had a headach for the last four hours; it
  will not leave you till six in the evening. You are right to take
  nothing; no human means can prevent its running its course.&quot;
  &quot;Can you tell me on which side is the pain?&quot; said Petetin.
  &quot;On the right side; it occupies the temple, the eye, the teeth:
  I warn you that it will invade the left eye, and that you will suffer
  considerably between three and four o&#39;clock; at six you will be
  free from pain.&quot; The prediction came out literally true.
  &quot;If you wish me to believe you, you must tell me what I hold in
  my hand?&quot; &quot;I see through your hand an antique
  medal.&quot;</p>

  <p>Petetin inquired of his patient at what hour her own fit would
  cease: &quot;at <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id=
  "Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span> eleven.&quot; &quot;And the evening
  accession, when will it come on?&quot; &quot;At seven
  o&#39;clock.&quot; &quot;In that case it will be later than
  usual.&quot; &quot;It is true; the periods of its recurrence are
  going to change to so and so.&quot; During this conversation, the
  patient&#39;s countenance expressed annoyance. She then said to M.
  Petetin, &quot;My uncle has just entered; he is conversing with my
  husband, <i>behind the screen</i>; his visit will fatigue me, beg him
  to go away.&quot; The uncle, leaving, took with him by mistake her
  husband&#39;s cloak, which she perceived, and sent her sister-in-law
  to reclaim it.</p>

  <p>In the evening, there were assembled, in the lady&#39;s apartment,
  a good number of her relations and friends. Petetin had,
  intentionally, placed a letter within his waistcoat, on his heart. He
  begged permission, on arriving, to wear his cloak. Scarcely had the
  lady, the access having come on, fallen into catalepsy, when she
  said, &quot;And how long, doctor, has it come into fashion to wear
  letters next the heart?&quot; Petetin pretended to deny the fact; she
  insisted on her correctness; and, raising her hands, designated the
  size, and indicated exactly the place of the letter. Petetin drew
  forth the letter, and held it, closed, to the fingers of the patient.
  &quot;If I were not a discreet person,&quot; she said, &quot;I should
  tell the contents; but to show you that I know them, they form
  exactly two lines and a half of writing;&quot; which, on opening the
  letter, was shown to be the fact.</p>

  <p>A friend of the family, who was present, took out his purse and
  put it in Dr Petetin&#39;s bosom, and folded his cloak over his
  chest. As soon as Petetin approached his patient, she told him that
  he had the purse, and named its exact contents. She then gave an
  inventory of the contents of the pockets of all present; adding some
  pointed remark when the opportunity offered. She said to her
  sister-in-law that the most interesting thing in <i>her</i>
  possession was a letter;&#8212;much to her surprise, for she had
  received the letter the same evening and had mentioned it to no
  one.</p>

  <p>The patient, in the mean time, lost strength daily, and could take
  no food. The means employed failed of giving her relief, and it never
  occurred to M. Petetin to inquire of her how he should treat her. At
  length, with some vague idea that she suffered from too great
  electric tension of the brain, he tried, fantastically enough, the
  effect of making deep inspirations, standing close in front of the
  patient. No effect followed from this absurd proceeding. <i>Then he
  placed one hand on the forehead, the other on the pit of the stomach
  of the patient</i>, and continued his inspirations. The patient now
  opened her eyes; her features lost their fixed look; she rallied
  rapidly from the fit, which lasted but a few minutes instead of the
  usual period of two hours more. In eight days, under a pursuance of
  this treatment, she entirely recovered from her fits, and with them
  ceased her extraordinary powers. But, during these eight days, her
  powers manifested a still greater extension; she foretold what was
  going to happen to her; she discussed, with astonishing subtlety,
  questions of mental philosophy and physiology; she caught what those
  around her meant to say, before they expressed their wishes, and
  either did what they desired, or begged that they would not ask her
  to do what was beyond her strength.</p>

  <p>In conclusion, let me animadvert upon the injustice with which, to
  its own loss, society has treated mesmerism. The use of mesmerism in
  nervous disorders, its use towards preventing suffering in surgical
  operations, have been denied and scoffed at in the teeth of positive
  evidence. The supposition of physical influence existing that can
  emanate from one human being and affect the nerves of another, was
  steadily combated as a gratuitous fiction, till Von Reichenbach&#39;s
  discoveries demonstrated its soundness. And, finally, the marvels of
  <i>clairvoyance</i> were considered an absolute proof of the
  visionary character of animal magnetism, because the world was
  ignorant that they occur independently of that influence, which only
  happens to be one of the modes of inducing the condition of trance in
  which they spontaneously manifest themselves. Adieu, dear Archy.</p>

  <p>Yours, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>Whatever may be the pursuits of our posterity, whether the mind of
  nations will turn on philosophy or politics, whether on a descent to
  the centre of the earth, or on the model of a general
  Utopia&#8212;whether on a telegraphic correspondence with the new
  planet, by a galvanised wire two thousand eight hundred and fifty
  millions of miles long, or on a Chartist government&#8212;we have not
  the slightest reason to doubt, that our generation will be regarded
  as having lived in the most brilliant time of the by-gone world.</p>

  <p>The years from 1789 to 1815 unquestionably include the most
  stirring period since the great primal convulsion, that barbarian
  deluge, which changed the face of Europe in the fifth century. But
  the vengeance which called the Vandal from his forest to crush the
  Roman empire, and after hewing down the Colossus which, for seven
  hundred years, had bestrode the world, moulded kingdoms out of its
  fragments, was of a totally different order from that which ruled
  over our great day of Change. In that original revolution, man, as
  the individual, was scarcely more than the sufferer. It was a vast
  outburst of force, as uncircumscribed as uncontrollable, and as
  unconnected with motives merely human, as an inroad of the ocean. It
  was a vast expanse of human existence, rushing surge on surge over
  the barriers of fair and fertile empire. It was hunger, and love of
  seizure, and hot thirst of blood, embodied in a mass of mankind
  rushing down upon luxury and profligacy, and governmental incapacity
  embodied in other masses of mankind. An invasion from the African
  wilderness with all its lions and leopards in full roar, could
  scarcely have less been urged by motives of human nature.</p>

  <p>But the great revolution which in our time shook Europe, and is
  still spreading its shock to the confines of the world, was
  <i>human</i> in the most remarkable degree. It was the work of
  impulses fierce and wild, yet peculiarly belonging to man. It was a
  succession of lights and shadows of human character, contrasted in
  the most powerful degree, as they passed before the eye of
  Europe&#8212;the ambition of man, the rage of man, the
  voluptuousness, the ferocity, the gallantry, and the fortitude of
  man, in all the varieties of human character. It was man in the robes
  of tragedy, comedy, and pantomime, but it was every where <i>man</i>.
  Every great event on which the revolution was suspended for the time,
  originated with some remarkable individual, and took its shape even
  from some peculiarity in that individual.</p>

  <p>Thus, the period of mob-massacre began with the sudden ascendency
  of Marat&#8212;a hideous assassin, who regarded the knife as the only
  instrument of governing, and proclaimed as his first principle of
  political regeneration, that &quot;half a million of heads must
  fall.&quot;</p>

  <p>The second stage, the Reign of Terror, began with Robespierre, a
  village lawyer; in whose mingled cruelty and craft originated the
  bloody mockeries of that &quot;Revolutionary Tribunal,&quot; which,
  under the semblance of trial, sent all the accused to the guillotine,
  and in all the formalities of justice committed wholesale murder.</p>

  <p>The third stage was the reign of the Directory&#8212;the work of
  the voluptuous Barras&#8212;and reflecting his profligacy in all the
  dissoluteness of a government of plunder and confiscation, closing in
  national debauchery and decay.</p>

  <p>The final stage was War&#8212;under the guidance of a man whose
  whole character displayed the most prominent features of soldiership.
  From that moment, the republic bore the sole impress of war. France
  had placed at her head the most impetuous, subtle, ferocious, and
  all-grasping, of the monarchs of mankind. She instantly took the
  shape which, like the magicians of old commanding their familiar
  spirits, the great magician of our age com<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>manded
  her to assume. Peace&#8212;the rights of man&#8212;the mutual ties of
  nations&#8212;the freedom of the serf and the slave&#8212;the
  subversion of all the abuses of the ancient thrones&#8212;all the old
  nominal principles of revolutionary patriotism, were instantly thrown
  aside, like the rude weapons of a peasant insurrection, the pike and
  the ox-goad, for the polished and powerful weapons of royal
  armouries. In all the conquests of France the serf and the slave were
  left in their chains; the continental kingdoms, bleeding by the sword
  until they lay in utter exhaustion, were suffered to retain all their
  abuses; the thrones, stripped of all their gold and jewels, were yet
  suffered to stand. Every pretext of moral and physical redress was
  contemptuously abandoned, and France herself exhibited the most
  singular of all transformations.&#8212;The republic naked, frantic,
  and covered with her own gore, was suddenly seen robed in the most
  superb investitures of monarchy; assuming the most formal etiquette
  of empire, and covered with royal titles. This was the most
  extraordinary change in the recollections of history, and for the
  next hundred, or for the next thousand years, it will excite wonder.
  But the whole period will be to posterity what Virgil describes the
  Italian plains to have been to the peasant of his day, a scene of
  gigantic recollections; as, turning up with the ploughshare the site
  of ancient battles, he finds the remnants of a race of bolder frame
  and more trenchant weapons&#8212;the weightier sword and the mightier
  arm.</p>

  <p>What the next age may develop in the arts of life, or the
  knowledge of nature, must remain in that limbo of vanity, to which
  Ariosto consigned embryo politicians, and Milton consigned departed
  friars&#8212;the world of the moon. But it will scarcely supply
  instances of more memorable individual faculties, or of more powerful
  effects produced by those faculties. The efforts of Conspiracy and
  Conquest in France, the efforts of Conservatism and Constitution in
  England, produced a race of men whom nothing but the crisis could
  have produced, and who will find no rivals in the magnitude of their
  capacities, the value of their services, in their loftiness of
  principle, and their influence on their age; until some similar
  summons shall be uttered to the latent powers of mankind, from some
  similar crisis of good and evil. The eloquence of Burke, Pitt, Fox,
  and a crowd of their followers, in the senate of England, and the
  almost fiendish vividness of the republican oratory, have remained
  without equals, and almost without imitators&#8212;the brilliancy of
  French soldiership, in a war which swept Europe with the swiftness
  and the devastation of a flight of locusts&#8212;the British
  campaigns of the Peninsula, those most consummate displays of
  fortitude and decision, of the science which baffles an enemy, and of
  the bravery which crushes him&#8212;will be lessons to the soldier in
  every period to come.</p>

  <p>But the foremost figure of the great history-piece of revolution,
  was the man, of whose latter hours we are now contemplating. Napoleon
  may not have been the ablest statesman, or the most scientific
  soldier, or the most resistless conqueror, or the most magnificent
  monarch of mankind&#8212;but what man of his day so closely combined
  all those characters, and was so distinguished in them all? It is
  idle to call him the child of chance&#8212;it is false to call his
  power the creation of opportunity&#8212;it is trifling with the
  common understanding of man, to doubt his genius. He was one of those
  few men, who are formed to guide great changes in the affairs of
  nations. The celebrity of his early career, and the support given to
  him by the disturbances of France, are nothing in the consideration
  of the philosopher; or perhaps they but separate him more widely from
  the course of things, and assimilate him more essentially with those
  resistless influences of nature, which, rising from we know not what,
  and operating we know not how, execute the penalties of
  Heaven:&#8212;those moral pestilences which, like the physical,
  springing from some spot of obscurity, and conveyed by the contact of
  the obscure, suddenly expand into universal contagion, and lay waste
  the mind of nations.</p>

  <p>In the earlier volumes of the Journal of Count Montholon, the
  assistance of Las Cases was used to collect the <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg
  180]</a></span>imperial <i>dicta</i>. But on the baron&#39;s being
  sent away from St Helena&#8212;an object which he appears to have
  sought with all the eagerness of one determined to make his escape,
  yet equally resolved on turning that escape into a subject of
  complaint&#8212;the duty of recording Napoleon&#39;s opinions
  devolved on Montholon. In the year 1818, Napoleon&#39;s health began
  visibly to break. His communications with O&#39;Meara, the surgeon
  appointed by the English government, became more frequent; and as
  Napoleon was never closely connected with any individual without an
  attempt to make him a partisan, the governor&#39;s suspicions were
  excited by this frequency of intercourse. We by no means desire to
  stain the memory of O&#39;Meara (he is since dead) with any
  dishonourable suspicion. But Sir Hudson Lowe cannot be blamed for
  watching such a captive with all imaginable vigilance. The
  recollection of the facility which too much dependance on his honour
  gave to Napoleon&#39;s escape from Elba, justly sharpened the caution
  of the governor. The fear of another European conflagration made the
  safeguard of the Ex-Emperor an object of essential policy, not merely
  to England, but to Europe; and the probability of similar convulsions
  rendered his detention at St Helena as high a duty as ever was
  intrusted to a British officer.</p>

  <p>We are not now about to discuss the charges made against Sir
  Hudson Lowe; but it is observable, that they are made solely on the
  authority of Napoleon, and of individuals dismissed for taking too
  strong an interest in that extraordinary man. Those complaints may be
  easily interpreted in the instance of the prisoner, as the results of
  such a spirit having been vexed by the circumstances of his
  tremendous fall; and also, in the instance of those who were
  dismissed, as a species of excuse for the transactions which produced
  their dismissal. But there can be no doubt that those complaints had
  not less the direct object of keeping the name of the Ex-Emperor
  before the eyes of Europe; that they were meant as stimulants to
  partisanship in France; and that, while they gratified the incurable
  bile of the fallen dynasty against England, they were also directed
  to produce the effect of reminding the French soldiery that Napoleon
  was still in existence.</p>

  <p>Yet there was a pettiness in all his remonstrances, wholly
  inconsistent with greatness of mind. He thus talks of Sir Hudson
  Lowe:&#8212;</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    &quot;I never look on him without being reminded of the assassin of
    Edward II. in the Castle of Berkeley, heating the bar of iron which
    was to be the instrument of his crime. Nature revolts against him.
    In my eyes she seems to have marked him, like Cain, with a seal of
    reprobation.&quot;
  </div>

  <p>Napoleon&#39;s knowledge of history was here shown to be pretty
  much on a par with his knowledge of scripture. The doubts regarding
  the death of Edward II. had evidently not come to his knowledge; and,
  so far as Cain was concerned, the sign was not one of reprobation,
  but of protection&#8212;it was a mark that &quot;no man should slay
  him.&quot;</p>

  <p>But all those complaints were utterly unworthy of a man who had
  played so memorable a part in the affairs of Europe. He who had
  filled the French throne had seen enough of this world&#39;s glory;
  and he who had fallen from it had been plunged into a depth of
  disaster, which ought to have made him regardless ever after of what
  man could do to him. A man of his rank ought to have disdained both
  the good and ill which he could receive from the governor of his
  prison. But he wanted the magnanimity that bears misfortune well:
  when he could no longer play the master of kingdoms, he was content
  to quarrel about valets; and having lost the world, to make a little
  occupation for himself in complaining of the want of etiquette in his
  dungeon. But the spirit of the intriguer survived every other spirit
  within him, and it is by no means certain that the return of
  O&#39;Meara and Gourgaud to Europe was not a part of that intrigue in
  which Napoleon played the Italian to the last hour of his life. It is
  true that the general returned under a certificate of ill health, and
  it is also perfectly possible that the surgeon was unconscious of the
  intrigue. But there can be no doubt of the design; and that design
  was, to excite a very considerable interest in Europe, on
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg
  181]</a></span>behalf of the prisoner of St Helena. Gourgaud,
  immediately after his arrival, wrote a long letter to Marie Louise,
  which was palpably intended more for the Emperors of Russia and
  Austria than for the feelings of the Ex-Empress, of whose interest in
  the matter the world has had no knowledge whatever.</p>

  <p>In this letter it was declared, that Napoleon was dying in the
  most frightful and prolonged agony. &quot;Yes, Madame,&quot; said
  this epistle, &quot;he whom Divine and human laws unite to you by the
  most sacred ties&#8212;he whom you have beheld an object of homage to
  almost all the sovereigns of Europe, and over whose fate I saw you
  shed so many tears when he left you, is perishing by a most cruel
  death&#8212;a captive on a rock in the midst of the ocean, at a
  distance of two thousand leagues from those whom he holds most
  dear.&quot;</p>

  <p>The letter then proceeds to point out the object of the appeal.
  &quot;These sufferings may continue for a long time. There is still
  time to save him: the moment seems very favourable. The Sovereigns
  are about to assemble at the Congress of
  Aix-la-Chapelle&#8212;passions seem calmed&#8212;Napoleon is now far
  from being formidable. In these circumstances let your Majesty deign
  to reflect what an effect a great step on your part would
  produce&#8212;that, for instance, of going to this Congress, and
  there soliciting a termination to the Emperor&#39;s sufferings, of
  supplicating your august father to unite his efforts with yours, in
  order to have Napoleon confided to his charge, if policy did not
  permit him to be restored to liberty; and how great would be your
  Majesty&#39;s own happiness: It would be said, the sovereigns of
  Europe, after having vanquished the great Napoleon, abandoned him to
  his most cruel enemies, they conducted him towards his grave by the
  most prolonged and barbarous torments, the continuation of his agony
  urged him even to demand more active executioners; he seemed
  forgotten, and without hope of aid; but Marie Louise remained to him,
  and he was restored to life.&quot;</p>

  <p>Whether this letter ever reached its address is not clear; but if
  it did, it produced no discoverable effect.</p>

  <p>But the absence of those confidants increased the troubles of the
  unlucky Montholon in a formidable degree, and Napoleon&#39;s habit of
  dictating his thoughts and recollections, (which he frequently
  continued for hours together, and sometimes into the middle of the
  night,) pressed heavily on the Count and Bertrand; the latter being
  excluded after six in the evening, when the sentinels were posted for
  the night, as he resided with his family, and thus devolving the task
  of the night on Montholon. Those dictations were sometimes on high
  questions of state, and on theories of war; sometimes on matters of
  the day, as in the following instance.</p>

  <p>The death of the Princess Charlotte, which threw the mind of
  England into such distress, had just been made known at St Helena.
  Napoleon spoke of it as reminding him of the perilous child-birth of
  Marie Louise. &quot;Had it not been for me,&quot; said he, &quot;she
  would have lost her life, like this poor Princess Charlotte. What a
  misfortune! young and beautiful, destined to the throne of a great
  nation, and to die for want of proper care on the part of her nearest
  relations! Where was her husband? where was her mother? why were they
  not beside her, as I was beside Marie Louise? She, too, would have
  died, had I left her to the care of the professional people. She owes
  her life to my being with her during the whole time of danger; for I
  shall never forget the moment when the accoucheur Dubois came to me
  pale with fright, and hardly able to articulate, and informed me that
  a choice must be made between the life of the mother and that of the
  child. The peril was imminent; there was not a moment to be lost in
  decision. &#39;Save the mother,&#39; said I&#8212;&#39;it is her
  right. Proceed just as you would do in the case of a citizen&#39;s
  wife of the Rue St Denis.&#39; It is a remarkable fact, that this
  answer produced an electric effect on Dubois. He recovered his
  <i>sang froid</i>, and calmly explained to me the causes of the
  danger. In a quarter of an hour afterwards, the King of Rome was
  born; but at first the infant was believed to be dead, he had
  suffered so much on coming into the world, and <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>it was
  with much difficulty that the physicians recalled him to
  life.&quot;</p>

  <p>It will probably be recollected as a similar instance of the
  advantage of care and decision, that Queen Caroline was rescued from
  the same hazard. Her accouchment was preceded by great suffering, and
  her strength seemed totally exhausted. The attendants were in a state
  of extreme alarm, when Lord Thurlow said, in his usual rough way,
  &quot;Don&#39;t think of princesses here: treat her like the
  washerwoman, and give her a glass of brandy.&quot; The advice was
  followed, and the Princess speedily recovered.</p>

  <p>Connected with the history of this short-lived son, is an
  anecdote, which Napoleon related as an instance of his own love of
  justice. When the palace was about to be built for the King of Rome
  at Passy, it was necessary to purchase some buildings which already
  stood on the ground. One of these was a hut belonging to a cooper,
  which the architects valued at a thousand francs. But the cooper,
  resolving to make the most of his tenure, now demanded ten times the
  sum. Napoleon ordered the money to be given to him; but when the
  contract was brought to him to sign, the fellow said, that &quot;as
  an Emperor disturbed him,&quot; he ought to pay for turning him out,
  and must give him thirty thousand francs. &quot;The good man is a
  little exacting,&quot; said Napoleon, &quot;still there is some sense
  in his argument. Give him the thirty thousand, and let me hear no
  more about it.&quot; But the cooper, thinking that he had a fine
  opportunity, now said that he could not take less than forty
  thousand. The architect did not know what to say; he dared not again
  mention the matter to the Emperor, and yet it was absolutely
  necessary to have the house. Napoleon learned what was passing, and
  was angry, but allowed the offer of the forty thousand. Again the
  dealer retracted, and demanded fifty thousand. &quot;He is a
  despicable creature,&quot; said the Emperor. &quot;I will have none
  of his paltry hut: it shall remain where it is, as a testimony of my
  respect for the law.&quot;</p>

  <p>The works were still going on at the time of the exile, in 1814;
  and, the cooper, finding himself in the midst of rubbish and building
  materials, groaned over the consequences of his folly, or rather of
  his extortion, for he had thus, deservedly, lost the opportunity of
  making his fortune.</p>

  <p>The death of Cipriani, the <i>maÃ®tre d&#39;hÃ´tel</i>, occurred
  about this time, and was startling from its suddenness. He was
  serving Napoleon&#39;s dinner, when he was attacked by such violent
  pains, that he was unable to reach his chamber without assistance. He
  rolled on the ground, uttering piercing cries. Four-and-twenty hours
  afterwards his coffin was carried to the cemetery of Plantation
  House! Cipriani had been employed in the secret police, and had
  distinguished himself by some difficult missions in the affairs of
  Naples and Northern Italy. It was only after the banishment to Elba
  that he had formed a part of the household. It was to Cipriani that
  the taking of Capri was owing. In 1806, Sir Hudson Lowe commanded at
  Capri, as lieutenant-colonel of a legion, composed of Corsican and
  Neapolitan deserters. The position of Capri in the Bay of Naples was
  of some importance for carrying on communications with those hostile
  to the French interest in Italy. Salicetti, prime minister of Naples,
  was vainly pondering on the capture of Capri; when it occurred to him
  to employ Cipriani, to put it into his power by surprise or
  treachery. Among the Corsicans under Sir H. Lowe&#39;s command, was
  one Suzanelli, a profligate, who had reduced himself by his
  debaucheries to acting as a spy. Cipriani soon ascertained that they
  had been fellow-students at college.</p>

  <p>The whole story is curious, as an instance of the dexterity of
  Italian treachery, and of the difficulty which an honest man must
  always find in dealing with that people. Cipriani instantly found out
  Suzanelli, who was then in Naples, and said, &quot;I know all, but we
  are fellow-countrymen&#8212;we have eaten the same soup: I do not
  desire to make you lose your head: choose between the scaffold, and
  making your fortune from your own country.&#8212;You are the spy of
  the English: help me to expel them from Capri, and your fortune is
  made. Refuse, and you are my prisoner, and will be shot within
  twenty-four hours.&quot; &quot;I take your offer,&quot; was the
  answer. &quot;What do you want with <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>me?&quot; Cipriani
  proposed to give him double what he received from the English, on
  condition of handing over all the letters which he received for
  Naples, and delivering the answers as if he had received them from
  the writers. Suzanelli thenceforth communicated all news relative to
  the movements of old Queen Caroline, and the British in the
  Mediterranean. Sir Hudson Lowe&#39;s confidence in Suzanelli was so
  much increased by the apparently important communications which the
  Neapolitan police had purposely made to him, that he rewarded him
  profusely, and at length accepted his offer of furnishing recruits to
  the Corsican legion at Capri. When the garrison was corrupted through
  the medium of those recruits, and an expedition was prepared at
  Naples, Suzanelli, in order to hoodwink the governor of Capri, whose
  vigilance might be awakened by the preparations, sent him a detailed
  report of the strength and object of the expedition, but telling him
  that it was meant to attack the Isle of Ponza. The expedition, under
  General La Marque, sailed at night, and the French effected their
  landing by surprise. The Royal Maltese regiment contained a great
  number of Suzanelli&#39;s recruits. They laid down their arms, and
  surrendered the forts in their charge. The commandant succeeded with
  difficulty in shutting himself up in the citadel with the royal
  Corsican regiment. It was inaccessible by assault, but the French
  dragged some heavy guns to a commanding height, and after a cannonade
  the garrison capitulated.</p>

  <p>This story is not exactly true; for the capitulation was
  <i>not</i> the result of the cannonade; but water and provisions had
  totally failed. The attempt made by an English frigate to succour the
  island had been frustrated by a violent gale, and there was no
  resource but to give up the island. Yet, if our memory is exact,
  there was <i>no</i> capitulation; for the garrison escaped without
  laying down their arms.</p>

  <p>It is proverbial, that great events frequently depend upon very
  little causes. All the world now blames the precipitancy of Napoleon
  in leaving Elba while the Congress was assembled. If he had waited
  until it was dissolved, he would have gained all the time which must
  have been lost by the Allies in reuniting their councils. The princes
  and diplomatists would have been scattered; the armies would have
  marched homewards; months would probably have elapsed before they
  could again have been brought into the field; and during that period,
  there would have been full opportunity for all the arts of intrigue
  and insinuation, which Napoleon so well knew how to use. Or, if he
  had delayed his return for a twelvemonth longer, he would have only
  found the obstacles so much the more diminished. In short, to him,
  the gain of time was every thing.</p>

  <p>His own narrative on the subject now was, that he had been misled;
  that he was fully sensible of the advantages of delay, but that
  accident had betrayed him. He had established a secret correspondence
  with Vienna, through which he received weekly accounts of all that
  had passed in Congress, and was prepared to act accordingly. One of
  his agents, De Chaboulon, arrived at Elba, at the same period with
  the Chevalier D&#39;Istria, (whom the King of Naples had sent with
  the despatch received from his ambassador at Vienna,) announcing the
  closing of the Congress, and the departure of the Emperor Alexander.
  On this intelligence Napoleon determined immediately to set sail for
  France, without waiting for the return of Cipriani, whom he had sent
  on a special mission. Had he waited for that return, the Emperor
  Alexander would have been on his way to Russia. But the result of his
  precipitancy was, that by rushing into France, while the emperors and
  diplomatists were still in combination, they were enabled to level
  the blow at him immediately. Instead of negotiations, he was pursued
  with a hue and cry; and instead of being treated as a prince, he was
  proclaimed an outlaw. Cipriani arrived in Elba on the 27th of
  February, but Napoleon had sailed on the evening of the 26th. So
  delicate was the interval between total ruin and what might have been
  final security; for Cipriani brought news of the Congress, and
  despatches from Vienna, which would have proved the im<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg
  184]</a></span>portance of delaying the departure of the
  expedition.</p>

  <p>But it must now be acknowledged that, if there ever was a human
  being under the influence of infatuation, that being was Napoleon, in
  the latter stages of his career. For ten years the favourite of
  fortune, the long arrear had begun to be paid in the year 1812. His
  expedition to Moscow was less a blunder than a frenzy. There was,
  perhaps, not one man in a thousand in Europe but foresaw the almost
  inevitable ruin of his army. We can recollect the rejoicing with
  which this perilous advance was viewed in England, and the universal
  prediction that the Russian deserts would be the grave of his army,
  if not of his empire. Poland had been conquered in a march and a
  month. The residence of Napoleon at Warsaw for the winter would have
  raised a Polish army for him, and would have given him a year for the
  march to Moscow. But he was <i>infatuated</i>: there is no other
  solution of the problem. He rushed on, captured the capital, and was
  ruined. Even with Moscow in ashes round him, he still persisted in
  the folly of supposing that he could persuade into peace an empire
  which had just given so tremendous an evidence of its fidelity and
  its fortitude. He was infatuated. He was detained amid the embers
  until it was impossible to remain longer, and equally impossible to
  escape the horrors of a Russian winter in a march of six hundred
  miles. His hour was come. Of an army which numbered four hundred
  thousand men on crossing the Niemen, probably not one thousand ever
  returned; for the broken troops which actually came back had been
  reinforcements which reached the Grand Army from time to time. He
  reached Paris with the stamp of fallen sovereignty on his brow: the
  remainder of his career was a struggle against his sentence. Waterloo
  was merely the scaffold: he was under irretrievable condemnation long
  before.</p>

  <p>In his captivity, Napoleon was liberal in his donatives. On the
  departure of Balcombe, in whose house he had remained for some time
  on his arrival in the island, he gave him a bill for seventy-two
  thousand francs, with the grant of a pension of twelve
  thousand,&#8212;saying to him &quot;I hear that your resignation of
  your employment is caused by the quarrels drawn upon you through the
  hospitality which you showed me: I should not wish you to regret ever
  having known me.&quot;</p>

  <p>A quarrel relative to the bulletins of Napoleon&#39;s health,
  produced an order from the governor for the arrest of O&#39;Meara.
  There was a vast quantity of peevishness exercised on the subject,
  and Napoleon attempted to raise this trifling affair into a general
  quarrel of the commissioners. But on his declaring that he would no
  longer receive the visits of O&#39;Meara while under arrest, the
  governor revoked the order, and O&#39;Meara continued his attendance
  until instructions were received from Lord Bathurst, to remove him
  from his situation in the household of the Emperor, and send him to
  England. This gave another opportunity for complaint. &quot;I have
  lived too long,&quot; said Buonaparte; &quot;your ministers are very
  bold. When the Pope was my prisoner, I would have cut off my arm
  rather than have signed an order for laying hands on his
  physician.&quot;</p>

  <p>Before leaving the island, O&#39;Meara drew up a statement of his
  patient&#39;s health, in which he seems to have regarded the liver as
  the chief seat of his disease. A copy of this paper reached home,
  when Cardinal Fesch and the mother of Napoleon had it examined by her
  own physician and four medical professors of the university. They
  also pronounced the disease to consist of an obstruction of the
  liver. So much for the certainty of medicine. The whole report is now
  known to have been a blunder. Napoleon ultimately died of a fearful
  disease, which probably has no connexion with the liver at all. His
  disease was cancer in the stomach.</p>

  <p>The result of those quarrels, however, was to give a less
  circumscribed promenade to Napoleon. On the decline of his health
  being distinctly stated to Sir Hudson Lowe, he enlarged the circle of
  his exercise, and Napoleon resumed his walks and works. From this
  period, too, he resumed those dictations which, in the form of notes,
  contained his personal opinions, or rather those apologies for his
  acts, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg
  185]</a></span>which he now became peculiarly anxious to leave behind
  him to posterity.</p>

  <p>Whatever may be the historic value of those notes, it is
  impossible to read them without the interest belonging to
  transactions which shook Europe, and without remembering that they
  were the language of a man by far the most remarkable of his time, if
  not the most remarkable for the result of his acts, since the fall of
  the Roman empire. In speaking of the return from Elba&#8212;&quot;I
  took,&quot; said he, &quot;that resolution as soon as it was proved
  to me that the Bourbons considered themselves as the continuance of
  the Third Dynasty, and denied the legal existence of the Republic,
  and the Empire, which were thenceforth to be regarded only as
  usurping governments. The consequences of this system were flagrant.
  It became the business of the bishops to reclaim their sees; the
  property of the clergy, and the emigrants must be restored. All the
  services rendered in the army of CondÃ© and in La VendÃ©e, all the acts
  of treachery committed in opening the gates of France to the armies
  which brought back the king, merited reward. All those rendered under
  the standard of the Republic and the Empire were acts of
  felony.&quot; He then gave his special view of the overthrow of the
  French monarchy.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    &quot;The Revolution of 1789 was a general attack of the masses
    upon the privileged classes. The nobles had occupied, either
    directly or indirectly, all the posts of justice, high and low.
    They were exempt from the charges of the state, and yet enjoyed all
    the advantages accruing from them, by the exclusive possession of
    all honourable and lucrative employments. The principal aim of the
    Revolution was to abolish those privileges.&quot; He then declared
    the advantages of the Revolution. &quot;It had established the
    right of every citizen, according to his merit, to attain to every
    employment; it had broken down the arbitrary divisions of the
    provinces, and out of many little nations formed a great one. It
    made the civil and criminal laws the same every where&#8212;the
    regulations and taxes the same every where. The half of the country
    changed its proprietors.&quot;
  </div>

  <p>This statement is true, and yet the mask is easily taken off the
  Revolution. The whole question is, whether the means by which it was
  purchased were not wholly unnecessary. It cost seven years of the
  most cruel and comprehensive wickedness that the world ever saw; and,
  when at last its violence overflowed the frontiers, it cost nearly a
  quarter of a century of slaughter, of ruthless plunder and savage
  devastation, concluding with the capture of the French capital
  itself, twice within two years, and the restoration of the royal
  family by the bayonets of the conquerors.</p>

  <p>Yet every beneficial change which was produced by the Revolution,
  at this enormous waste of national strength and human happiness, had
  been offered by the French throne before a drop of blood was shed;
  and was disdained by the leaders of the populace, in their palpable
  preference for the havoc of their species.</p>

  <p>In the beginning of November, 1818, Sir Hudson Lowe communicated
  to Count Montholon a despatch from Lord Bathurst announcing the
  departure from Italy of two priests, a physician, a <i>maÃ®tre
  d&#39;hÃ´tel</i> and cook, sent by Cardinal Fesch, for the service of
  Longwood. This news was received by the household with joy, in
  consequence of Napoleon&#39;s declining health. Towards the end of
  November he became worse; and Dr Stock, the surgeon of one of the
  ships on the station, was sent for, and attended him for a while.
  Liver complaint was Napoleon&#39;s disease in the opinion of the
  doctor; the true disease having escaped them all. The paroxysm passed
  off, and for six weeks his constitution seemed to be getting the
  better of his disease.</p>

  <p>The complaints of the governor&#39;s conduct appear to have been
  kept up with the same restless assiduity. If we are to judge from a
  conversation with Montholon, those complaints were of the most
  vexatious order. &quot;It is very hard,&quot; said Sir Hudson,
  &quot;that I who take so much care to avoid doing what is
  disagreeable, should be constantly made the victim of calumnies; that
  I should be presented as an object of ridicule to the eyes of the
  European powers; that the commissioners of the great powers
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg
  186]</a></span>should say to me themselves, that Count Bertrand had
  declared to them that I was a fool; that I could not be sure that the
  Emperor was at Longwood; that I had been forty days without seeing
  him; and that he might be dead without my knowing any thing of
  it.&quot; He further said that the newspapers, and particularly the
  <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, were full of articles which represented him
  as an assassin. But in the mean time, it was necessary that the
  orderly officer should see Napoleon every day, and that this might be
  done in any way he pleased. All that was necessary was, that he
  should be seen.</p>

  <p>Yet this demand of seeing him, which was thus expressed in
  moderate terms, and obviously essential to his safe keeping, was
  answered in the lofty style of a melodrama. &quot;Count Bertrand and
  myself have both informed you, sir, that you should never violate the
  Emperor&#39;s privacy without forcing his doors, and shedding
  blood.&quot;</p>

  <p>A great deal of the pretended irritation of Napoleon and his
  household, arose from the governor&#39;s omission of the word Emperor
  in his notes; and on this subject a cavil had existed even in
  England. Yet what could be more childish than such a cavil, either in
  England or in St Helena? It is a well-known diplomatic rule, that no
  title which a new power may give to itself can be acknowledged,
  except as a matter of distinct negotiation; and those Frenchmen must
  have known that the governor had no right to acknowledge a title,
  which had never been acknowledged by the British Cabinet.</p>

  <p>At length the quarrel rose to bullying. The governor having
  insisted on his point, that Napoleon should be seen by the orderly
  officer; this was fiercely refused; and at length Bertrand made use
  of offensive language, filling up the offence by a challenge to the
  governor. The most surprising matter in the whole business is, that
  Sir Hudson did not instantly send the blusterer to the black-hole. It
  was obvious that the idea of fighting with men under his charge was
  preposterous. But he still, and we think injudiciously, as a matter
  of the code of honour, wrote, that if Count Bertrand had not patience
  to wait another opportunity, as he could not fight his
  <i>prisoner</i>, he might satisfy his rage by fighting
  Lieutenant-Colonel Lyster, the bearer of his reply, who was perfectly
  ready to draw his sword. Of this opportunity, however, the Count had
  the wisdom to avoid taking advantage.</p>

  <p>The whole question now turned on the admission of the orderly
  officer, to have personal evidence that Napoleon was still in the
  island&#8212;a matter of obvious necessity, for Europe at that time
  teemed with the projects of Revolutionary Frenchmen for setting him
  free. His escape would have ruined the governor; but even if it had
  been a matter of personal indifference to him, his sense of the
  public evils which might be produced by the return of this most
  dangerous of all incendiaries would doubtless have made his detention
  one of the first duties.</p>

  <p>However, finding at last that the state of Napoleon&#39;s health
  might afford a sufficient guarantee against immediate escape, and
  evidently with the purpose of softening the irritation between them
  as much as possible, it was finally, though &quot;temporarily,&quot;
  agreed to take Montholon&#39;s word for his being at Longwood. On the
  21st of September, the priests and Dr Antomarchi arrived. Napoleon,
  always active and inventive, now attempted to interest the Emperor of
  Russia in his liberation. It must be owned, that this was rather a
  bold attempt for the man who had invaded Russia, ravaged its
  provinces, massacred its troops, and finished by leaving Moscow in
  flames. But he dexterously limited himself to explaining the seizure
  of the Duchy of Oldenburg, which was the commencement of the
  rapacious and absurd attempt to exclude English merchandise from the
  Continent. Oldenburg was one of the chief entrances by which those
  manufactures made their way into Germany. Its invasion, and the
  countless robberies which followed, had been among the first
  insolences of Napoleon, and the cause of the first irritations of
  Alexander, as his sister was married to the reigning prince. Napoleon
  lays the entire blame on Davoust, whom he charges with both the
  conception <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg
  187]</a></span>and the execution. But if he had disapproved of the
  act, why had he not annulled it? &quot;I was on the point of doing
  so,&quot; said Napoleon, &quot;when I received a menacing note from
  Russia; but,&quot; said he, &quot;from the moment when the honour of
  France was implicated, I could no longer disapprove of the
  marshal&#39;s proceedings.&quot; He glides over the invasion of
  Russia with the same unhesitating facility. &quot;I made war,&quot;
  said he, &quot;against Russia, in spite of myself. I knew better than
  the libellers who reproached me with it, that Spain was a devouring
  cancer which I ought to cure before engaging myself in a terrible
  struggle, the first blow of which would be struck at a distance of
  five hundred leagues from my frontiers. Poland and its resources were
  but poetry, in the first months of the year 1812.&quot; He then
  adroitly flatters the Russian nation. &quot;I was not so mad as to
  think that I could conquer Russia without immense efforts. I knew the
  bravery of the Russian army. The war of 1807 had proved it to
  me.&quot; He then hints at the subject of his conversations at
  Erfurth, and discloses some of those curious projects, by which
  France and Russia were to divide the world. He says that Alexander
  offered to exchange his Polish provinces for Constantinople. Under
  this arrangement Syria and Egypt would have supplied to France the
  loss of her colonies. He then admits that he had desired to marry the
  Grand-duchess; and, finally asserting that the dynasty of the
  Bourbons was forced upon the people, he declares himself willing to
  accept of Russian intervention to save himself from the
  &quot;martyrdom of that rock.&quot;</p>

  <p>It is evident that the conduct of the governor was constantly
  guided by a wish to consult the convenience of his prisoner; but the
  most important point of all was to guard against his escape.
  Gradually the relaxations as to the limits of his movements became
  more satisfactory even to the household themselves; and for some time
  in the latter period of 1819 Napoleon was suffered to ride to
  considerable distances in the island, without the attendance of all
  English officer. He now took long rides&#8212;among others, one to
  the house of Sir William Doveton, on the other side of the island. In
  the evenings he dictated narratives relative to some of the more
  prominent points of his history, for the purpose of their being sent
  to Europe, where he was determined, at least, never to let the
  interest of his name die, and where, though he was practically
  forgotten, this clever but utterly selfish individual deceived
  himself into the belief that thousands and tens of thousands were
  ready to sacrifice every thing for his restoration. On one of these
  evenings he gave his own version of the revolt of Marshal Ney.</p>

  <p>It will be remembered that Ney, when the command of the troops was
  given to him by Louis XVIII. made a dashing speech to the King,
  declaring that &quot;he would bring back the monster in an iron
  cage.&quot; But it happened that he had no sooner seen the monster,
  than he walked over to him with his whole army. This was an offence
  not to be forgiven; and the result was, that on the restoration of
  the King, Ney was tried by a court-martial, and shot.</p>

  <p>Of course, there could be but one opinion of this unfortunate
  officer&#39;s conduct; but it is curious to observe the romantic
  colour which Napoleon&#39;s dexterous fancy contrived to throw over
  the whole scene.</p>

  <p>&quot;Marshal Ney,&quot; said he, &quot;was perfectly loyal, when
  he received his last orders from the King. But his fiery soul could
  not fail to be deeply impressed by the intoxicating enthusiasm of the
  population of the provinces, which was daily depriving him of some of
  his best troops, for the national colours were hoisted on all
  sides.&quot; Notwithstanding this, Ney, when the Emperor was ready at
  Lyons, resisted his recollections, until he received the following
  letter from the Emperor. &quot;Then he yielded, and again placed
  himself under the banner of the empire.&quot;</p>

  <p>The letter was the following pithy
  performance:&#8212;&quot;Cousin, my major-general sends you the order
  of march. I do not doubt that the moment you heard of my arrival at
  Lyons, you again raised the tricolored standards among your troops.
  Execute the orders of Bertrand, and come and join me at Chalons. I
  will receive <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id=
  "Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>you as I did the morning after the
  battle of Moscow.&quot; It must be acknowledged that the man who
  could have been seduced by this letter must have been a simpleton: it
  has all the arrogance of a master, and even if he had been perfectly
  free, it was evident that obedience would have made him a slave. But
  he had given a solemn pledge to the King; he had been given the
  command of the army on the strength of that pledge; and in carrying
  it over to the enemy of the King, he compromised the honour and
  hazarded the life of every man among them. The act was unpardonable,
  and he soon found it to be fatally so.</p>

  <p>Napoleon makes no reference to the pledge, to the point of honour
  or the point of duty, but pronounces his death a judicial
  assassination. Still, he is evidently not quite clear on the subject;
  for he says, that even if he had been guilty, his services to his
  country ought to have arrested the hand of justice.</p>

  <p>Napoleon sometimes told interesting tales of his early career. One
  of those, if true, shows how near the world was to the loss of an
  Emperor. After the siege of Toulon, which his panegyrists regard as
  the first step to his good fortune, he returned to Paris, apparently
  in the worst possible mood for adventure. He was at this period
  suffering from illness. His mother, too, had just communicated to him
  the discomforts of her position.&#8212;She had been just obliged to
  fly from Corsica, where the people were in a state of insurrection,
  and she was then at Marseilles, without any means of subsistence.
  Napoleon had nothing remaining, but an assignat of one hundred sous,
  his pay being in arrear. &quot;In this state of dejection I went
  out,&quot; said he, &quot;as if urged to suicide by an animal
  instinct, and walked along the quays, feeling my weakness, but unable
  to conquer it. In a few more moments I should have thrown myself into
  the water, when I ran against an individual dressed like a simple
  mechanic, and who, recognising me, threw himself on my neck, and
  cried, &#39;Is it you, Napoleon? what joy to see you again!&#39; It
  was Demasis, a former comrade of mine in the artillery regiment. He
  had emigrated, and had returned to France in disguise, to see his
  aged mother. He was about to go, when, stopping, he said, &#39;What
  is the matter? You do not listen to me. You do not seem glad to see
  me. What misfortune threatens you? You look to me, like a madman
  about to kill himself.&#39;&quot;</p>

  <p>This direct appeal awoke Napoleon&#39;s feelings, and he told him
  every thing. &quot;Is that all?&quot; said he; opening his coarse
  waistcoat, and detaching a belt, he added, &quot;here are thirty
  thousand francs in gold, take them and save your mother.&quot;
  &quot;I cannot,&quot; said Napoleon, &quot;to this day, explain to
  myself my motives for so doing, but I seized the gold as if by a
  convulsive movement, and ran like a madman to send it to my mother.
  It was not until it was out of my hands, that I thought of what I had
  done. I hastened back to the spot where I had left Demasis, but he
  was no longer there. For several days I went out in the morning,
  returning not until evening, searching every place where I hoped to
  find him.&quot;</p>

  <p>The end of the romance is as eccentric as the beginning. For
  fifteen years Napoleon saw no more of his creditor. At the end of
  that time he discovered him, and asked &quot;why he had not applied
  to the Emperor.&quot; The answer was, that he had no necessity for
  the money, but was afraid of being compelled to quit his retirement,
  where he lived happily practising horticulture.</p>

  <p>Napoleon now paid his debt, as it maybe presumed, magnificently;
  made him accept three hundred thousand francs as a reimbursement from
  the Emperor for the thirty thousand lent to the subaltern of
  artillery; and besides, made him director-general of the gardens of
  the crown, with a salary of thirty thousand francs. He also gave a
  government place to his brother.</p>

  <p>Napoleon, who seems always to have had some floating ideas of
  fatalism in his mind, remarked that two of his comrades, Demasis and
  Philipeau, had peculiar influence on his destiny. Philipeau had
  emigrated, and was the engineer employed by Sir Sydney Smith to
  construct the defences of Acre. We have seen that Demasis stopped him
  at the moment when he was <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189"
  id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>about to drown himself.
  &quot;Philipeau,&quot; said he, &quot;stopped me before St Jean
  d&#39;Acre: but for him, I should have been master of this key of the
  East. I should have marched upon Constantinople, and rebuilt the
  throne of the East.&quot;</p>

  <p>This idea of sitting on the throne of the Turk, seems never to
  have left Napoleon&#39;s mind. He was always talking of it, or
  dreaming of it. But it may fairly be doubted, whether he could ever
  have found his way out of Syria himself. With his fleet destroyed by
  Nelson, and his march along the coast&#8212;perhaps the only
  practicable road&#8212;harassed by the English cruisers; with the
  whole Turkish army ready to meet him in the defiles of Mount Taurus;
  with Asia Minor still to be passed; and with the English, Russian,
  and Turkish fleets and forces ready to meet him at Constantinople,
  his death or capture would seem to be the certain consequence of his
  fantastic expedition. The strongest imaginable probability is, that
  instead of wearing the diadem of France, his head would have figured
  on the spikes of the seraglio.</p>

  <p>Suicide is so often the unhappy resource of men indifferent to all
  religion, that we can scarcely be surprised at its having been
  contemplated more than once by a man of fierce passions, exposed to
  the reverses of a life like Napoleon&#39;s. Of the dreadful audacity
  of a crime, which directly wars with the Divine will, which cuts off
  all possibility of repentance, and which thus sends the criminal
  before his Judge with all his sins upon his head, there can be no
  conceivable doubt. The only palliative can be, growing insanity. But
  in the instance which is now stated by the intended self-murderer,
  there is no attempt at palliation of any kind.</p>

  <p>&quot;There was another period of my life,&quot; said Napoleon,
  &quot;when I attempted suicide; but you are certainly acquainted with
  this fact.&quot; &quot;No, sire,&quot; was Montholon&#39;s reply.</p>

  <p>&quot;In that case, write what I shall tell you: for it is well
  that the mysteries of Fontainbleau should one day be known.&quot;</p>

  <p>We condense into a few sentences this singular narrative, which
  begins with an interview demanded by his marshals on the 4th of April
  1815, when he was preparing to move at the head of his army to attack
  the Allies. The language of the marshals was emphatic.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    &quot;The army is weary, discouraged, disorganised; desertion is at
    work among the ranks. To re-enter Paris cannot be thought of: in
    attempting to do so we should uselessly shed blood.&quot;
  </div>

  <p>Their proposal was, his resignation in favour of his son.</p>

  <p>Caulaincourt had already brought him the Emperor Alexander&#39;s
  opinion on the subject. The envoy had thus reported the imperial
  conversation:&#8212;&quot;I carry on no diplomacy with you, but I
  cannot tell you every thing. Understand this, and lose not a moment
  in rendering an account to the Emperor Napoleon of our conversation,
  and of the situation of his affairs here; and return again as
  quickly, bringing his abdication in favour of his son. As to his
  personal fate, I give you my word of honour that he will be properly
  treated. But lose not an hour, or all is lost for him, and I shall no
  longer have power to do any thing either for him or his
  dynasty.&quot;</p>

  <p>Napoleon proceeds. &quot;I hesitated not to make the sacrifice
  demanded of my patriotism. I sat down at a little table, and wrote my
  Act of Abdication in favour of my son.&quot; But on that day Marmont
  with his army had surrendered. The Allies instantly rejected all
  negotiation, after this decisive blow in their favour. The Act of
  Resignation had not reached them, and they determined on restoring
  the old monarchy at once. On this the desertion was universal; and
  every man at Fontainbleau was evidently thinking only of being the
  first to make his bargain with the Bourbons. Napoleon, as a last
  experiment, proposed to try the effect of war in Italy.</p>

  <p>But all shook their heads, and were silent. He at length signed
  the unequivocal Abdication for himself, and his family.</p>

  <p>&quot;From the time of my retreat from Russia,&quot; said he,
  &quot;I had constantly carried round my neck, in a little silken bag,
  a portion of a poisonous powder which Ivan had prepared by my orders,
  when I was in fear of being <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190"
  id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>carried off by the Cossacks. My life
  no longer belonged to my country; the events of the last few days had
  again rendered me master of it. Why should I endure so much
  suffering? and who knows, that my death may not place the crown on
  the head of my son? France was saved.&quot;&#8212;</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>&quot;I hesitated no longer, but, leaping from my bed, mixed the
    poison in a little water, and drank it, with a sort of
    happiness.</p>

    <p>&quot;But time had taken away its strength; fearful pains drew
    forth some groans from me; they were heard, and medical assistance
    arrived. It was not Heaven&#39;s will that I should die so
    soon&#8212;St Helena was in my <i>Destiny</i>.&quot;</p>
  </div>

  <p>It may easily be supposed that projects were formed for carrying
  the prisoner from St Helena. One of those is thus detailed. The
  captain of a vessel returning from India, had arranged to bring a
  boat to a certain point of the coast without running the risk of
  being stopped. This person demanded a million of francs, not, as he
  said, for himself, but for the individual whose concurrence was
  necessary. The million was not to be payable until the vessel had
  reached America. This renders it probable that the captain was a
  Yankee. At all events, it shows how necessary was the vigilance of
  the governor, and how little connected with tyranny were his
  precautions against evasion. Another project was to be carried out,
  by submarine vessels, and on this experiment five or six thousand
  Louis were expended in Europe. But Napoleon finished his inquiry into
  these matters by refusing to have any thing to do with them. It is
  probable that he expected his release on easier terms than those of
  breaking his neck, as Montholon observes, &quot;in descending the
  precipices of St Helena,&quot; or being starved, shot, or drowned on
  his passage across the Atlantic. But as his object was constantly to
  throw obloquy on the Bourbons, he placed his fears to the account of
  their treachery.</p>

  <p>&quot;I should not,&quot; said he, &quot;be six months in America
  without being assassinated by the Count d&#39;Artois&#39;s creatures.
  Remember the isle of Elba. Did he not send the <i>Chouan Brulard</i>
  there to organise my assassination? And besides, we should always
  obey our destiny. Every thing is written in Heaven. It is my
  martyrdom which will restore the crown of France to my dynasty. I see
  in America nothing but assassination or oblivion. I prefer St
  Helena.&quot;</p>

  <p>In the beginning of 1821, Napoleon began to grow lethargic. He had
  generally spent the day in pacing up and down his apartment, and
  dictating conversations and political recollections. But he now sat
  for hours listlessly and perfectly silent on the sofa. It required
  the strongest persuasion to induce him to take the air either on foot
  or <i>en calÃªche</i>.</p>

  <p>Napoleon to the last was fond of burlesquing the hypocrisy or
  romance of the Revolution. The 18th of <i>Brumaire</i>, which made
  him First Consul, and had given him two colleagues, gave him the
  opportunity of developing the patriotism of the Republic. Shortly
  after that period, Sieyes, supping with the heads of the Republican
  party, said to them, at the same time throwing his cap violently on
  the ground, &quot;There is no longer a Republic. I have for the last
  eight days been conferring with a man who knows every thing. He needs
  neither counsel nor aid; policy, laws, and the art of government are
  all as familiar to him as the command of an army. I repeat to you,
  there is no longer a Republic.&quot;</p>

  <p>Sieyes was well known to be what the French call an
  <i>idealogue</i>. He was a theorist on governments, which he invented
  in any convenient number. For the Consulate he had his theory ready.
  The First Consul was to be like an epicurean divinity, enjoying
  himself and taking care for no one. But this tranquillity of
  position, and nonentity of power, by no means suited the taste of
  Napoleon. &quot;&#39;Your Grand Elector,&quot; said he (the title
  which seems to have been intended for his head of his new
  constitution,) &quot;would be nothing but an idle king. The time for
  do-nothing kings is gone by&#8212;six millions of francs and the
  Tuilleries, to play the stage-king in, put his signature to other
  peoples work, and do nothing of himself, is a dream. Your Grand
  Elector would be nothing but a pig to fatten, or a master, the more
  absolute because he would have no responsibility.&#39; It
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg
  191]</a></span>was on quitting me after this conversation,&quot; said
  Napoleon, &quot;that Sieyes said to Roger Ducos, &#39;My dear
  Colleague, we have not a President, we have a master. You and I have
  no more to do, but to make our fortunes before making our
  <i>paquets</i>.&#39;&quot; This was at least plain speaking, and it
  discloses the secret of ninety-nine out of every hundred of the
  Republicans.</p>

  <p>An amusing anecdote of the memorable AbbÃ© is then told. He was
  Almoner to one of the Princesses of France. One day, while he was
  reading mass, the Princess, from some accidental circumstance,
  retired, and her ladies followed her. Sieyes, who was busy reading
  his missal, did not at first perceive her departure; but when he saw
  himself abandoned by all the great people, and had no auditory left
  but the domestics, he closed the book, and left the altar, crying,
  &quot;I do not say mass for the rabble!&quot; This certainly was not
  very democratic, and yet Sieyes was soon afterwards the most rampant
  of all possible democrats.</p>

  <p>The history of his patriotism, however, alike accounted for his
  former contempt and his subsequent fraternisation. Previously to the
  Revolution he was poor, neglected, and angry; but, as he was known to
  be a man of ability, his name was mentioned to De Brienne, who,
  though an archbishop, was Prime Minister. He was desired to attend at
  his next levee; he attended, and was overlooked. He complained to his
  friend, who repeated the complaint to the archbishop, who desired him
  to appear at his levee; but was so much occupied with higher people,
  that the clever but luckless AbbÃ© was again overlooked. He made a
  third experiment, on the promise that he should obtain audience; but
  he found the Archbishop enveloped in a circle of <i>epaulets</i>,
  <i>grands cordons</i>, and mitres. To penetrate this circle was
  impossible, and the AbbÃ©, now furious at what he regarded as a
  mockery, rushed to his chamber, seized a pen, and wrote his powerful
  and memorable pamphlet entitled, &quot;What is the third
  Estate?&quot; a fierce, but most forcible appeal to the vanity of the
  lower orders, pronouncing them <i>the</i> nation. This was a torch
  thrown into a powder magazine&#8212;all was explosion; the church,
  the noblesse, and the monarchy were suddenly extinguished, and France
  saw this man of long views and powerful passions, suddenly raised
  from hunger and obscurity, to the highest rank and the richest
  sinecurism of the republic.</p>

  <p>Antomarchi was not fortunate in his attendance on Napoleon. Of
  course he felt, like every other foreigner, the ennui of the island,
  and he grew impatient to return to Europe. At last he applied for
  permission, which Napoleon gave him in the shape of a discharge, with
  the following sting at the end. &quot;During the fifteen months which
  we have spent in this country, you have given his Majesty no
  confidence in your moral character. You can be of no use to him in
  his illness, and your residing here for several months longer would
  have no object, and be of no use.&quot; However, a reconciliation was
  effected, and the doctor was suffered to remain. But all the
  household now began to be intolerably tired. Three of the household,
  including the AbbÃ©, requested their congÃ©.</p>

  <p>There is in the spirit of the foreigner a kind of gross levity, an
  affectation of frivolity with respect to women, and a continual habit
  of vulgar vanity, which seems to run through all ranks and ages of
  the continental world. What can be more offensively trifling, than
  the conduct which Napoleon narrates of himself, when Emperor, at
  Warsaw.</p>

  <p>A Madame Waleska seems to have been the general belle of the city.
  On the night when Napoleon first saw this woman, at a ball, General
  Bertrand and Louis de Perigord appeared as her public admirers.
  &quot;They both,&quot; said he, &quot;kept hovering emulously round
  her.&quot; But Napoleon, Emperor, husband, and mature as he was,
  chose to play the gallant on this evening also. Finding the two
  Frenchmen in the way of his attentions, he played the Emperor with
  effect on the spot. He gave an order to Berthier, then head of his
  staff, instantly to send off M. Perigord &quot;to obtain news of the
  6th corps,&quot; which was on the Passarge. Thus one inconvenience
  was got rid of, but Bertrand was still present, and during supper his
  attentions were so marked that, as he leaned over Madame&#39;s chair,
  his aiguilettes danced on her shoulders. &quot;Upon this,&quot; said
  Napoleon, &quot;my impatience was roused to <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>such a
  pitch that I touched him on the arm and drew him to the recess of a
  window, where I gave him orders &#39;to set out for the head-quarters
  of Prince Jerome,&#39; and without losing an hour to bring me a
  report of the siege of Breslau.&quot; Such it is to come in the way
  of Emperors. &quot;The poor fellow was scarcely gone,&quot; adds
  Napoleon, &quot;when I repented of my angry impulse; and I should
  certainly have recalled him, had I not remembered at the same minute
  that his presence with Jerome would be useful to me.&quot; And this
  was the conduct of a man then in the highest position of life, whose
  example must have been a model to the multitude, and in whom even
  frivolity would be a crime.</p>

  <p>Napoleon had long lived in a state of nervous fear, which must
  have made even his high position comfortless to him. He had been for
  years in dread of poison. &quot;I have escaped poisoning,&quot; said
  he, &quot;ten times, if I have once.&quot; In St Helena he never eat
  or drank any thing which had not been tasted first by one of the
  household! Montholon, during the night, constantly tasted the drink
  prepared for him. On this subject, Napoleon told the following
  anecdote.</p>

  <p>&quot;He was one day leaving the dinner-table with the Empress
  Josephine, and two or three other persons, when, as he was about to
  put his hand in his pocket for his snuff-box, he perceived it lying
  on the mantel-piece, in the saloon which he was entering. He was
  about to open it and take a pinch, when his good star caused him to
  seat himself. He then felt that his snuff-box was in one of his
  pockets. This excited inquiry, and on sending the two boxes to be
  chemically tested, the snuff on the mantel-piece was discovered to be
  poisoned.&quot; After this, it is somewhat absurd in M. Montholon to
  give his hero credit for <i>sang froid</i>, and say of him, that no
  one could take fewer precautions against such dangers than the
  Emperor. His whole life seems to have been precautionary; still, he
  sententiously talked the nonsense of fatalism.</p>

  <p>&quot;Our last hour is written above,&quot; was his frequent
  remark. He had some absurdities on the subject of medicine, which
  would have very effectually assisted the fulfilment of this
  prediction. He had all idea that he should cure himself of his
  immediate disease, and perhaps of every other, by swallowing
  orange-flower water, and soup <i>Ã  la reine</i>.</p>

  <p>The governor, during this period, constantly offered the services
  of an English physician; and Dr Arnott was at last summoned, who
  pronounced the disease to be very serious, and to be connected with
  great inflammation in the region of the stomach. It was now, for the
  first time, ascertained that his disease was ulceration of the
  stomach. There is an occasional tribute to the humane conduct of the
  governor at this time. On April eleventh, there is this
  memorandum:&#8212;</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    &quot;Sir Hudson Lowe has left us in perfect tranquillity, since Dr
    Arnott has been admitted, though he comes every day to the
    apartments of the orderly officer, for the purpose of conferring
    with the physician.&quot;
  </div>

  <p>Napoleon, now conscious of the dangerous nature of his disease,
  made his will. He had conceived that he was worth in various property
  about two hundred millions of francs, which he left by will, but of
  which we believe the greater part was impounded by the French
  government, as being public property.</p>

  <p>He now held a long conversation on the prospects of his son, whom
  he regarded as not altogether beyond the hope of ascending the throne
  of France. He predicted the fall of the reigning family. &quot;The
  Bourbons,&quot; said he, &quot;will not maintain their position after
  my death.&quot; With an exactness equally odd, but equally true, he
  predicted the rise of another branch of the dynasty: &quot;My son
  will arrive, after a time of troubles; he has but one party to fear,
  that of the Duke of Orleans. That party has been germinating for a
  long time. France is the country where the chiefs of parties have the
  least interest. To rest for support on them, is to build their hopes
  on sand.&quot;</p>

  <p>There is a brilliant shrewdness now and then, in his contempt of
  the showy exhibitors in public life. &quot;The great orators,&quot;
  said he, &quot;who rule the assemblies by <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>the
  brilliancy of their eloquence, are in general men of the most
  mediocre talents. They should not be opposed in their own way, for
  they have always more noisy words at command than you. In my council
  there were men possessed of much more eloquence than I was, but I
  always defeated them by this simple argument,&#8212;Two and two make
  four.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>&quot;My son will be obliged to allow the liberty of the press.
    This is a necessity in the present day. My son ought to be a man of
    new ideas, and of the cause which have made triumphant every
    where.</p>

    <p>&quot;Let my son often read and reflect on history: that is the
    only true philosophy. Let him read and meditate on the wars of the
    great Captains. That is the only means of rightly learning the
    science of war.&quot;</p>
  </div>

  <p>In April, the signs of debility grew still more marked. On the
  26th, at four in the morning, after a calm night, he had what
  Montholon regards as a dream, but what Napoleon evidently regarded as
  a vision. He said with extraordinary emotion, &quot;I have just seen
  my good Josephine, but she would not embrace me; she disappeared at
  the moment when I was about to take her in my arms; she was seated
  <i>there</i>; it seemed to me that I had seen her yesterday evening;
  she is not changed&#8212;still the same, full of devotion to me; she
  told me that we were about to see each other again, never more to
  part. She assured me of that. Did you see her?&quot;</p>

  <p>Montholon attributed this scene to feverish excitement, gave him
  his potion, and he fell asleep; but on awaking he again spoke of the
  Empress Josephine.</p>

  <p>It is difficult in speaking of dreams and actual visions, to know
  the distinction. That the mind may be so perfectly acted upon during
  the waking hours as to retain the impressions during sleep, is the
  experience of every day. And yet we know so little of the means by
  which truths may be communicated to the human spirit while the senses
  are closed, that it would be unphilosophical to pronounce even upon
  those fugitive thoughts as unreal. That Napoleon must have often
  reflected on his selfish and cruel desertion of Josephine, it is
  perfectly natural to conceive. That he may have bitterly regretted
  it, is equally natural, for, from that day, his good fortune deserted
  him. And he might also have discovered that he had committed a great
  crime, with no other fruit than that of making a useless alliance,
  encumbering himself with an ungenial companion, and leaving an orphan
  child dependant on strangers, and continually tantalised by the
  recollections of a fallen throne. Those feelings, in the solitude of
  his chamber, and the general dejection of his captivity, must have so
  often clouded his declining hours, that no miracle was required to
  embody them in such a vision as that described. And yet, so many
  visitations of this kind have undoubtedly occurred, that it would be
  rash to pronounce that this sight of the woman who had so long been
  the partner of his brilliant days might not have been given, to
  impress its moral on the few melancholy hours which now lay between
  him and the grave.</p>

  <p>It is painful, after a scene which implies some softness of heart,
  to find him unrepentant of one of the most repulsive, because the
  most gratuitous crime of his career. In the course of the day,
  Bertrand, in translating an English journal, inadvertently began to
  read an article containing a violent attack on the conduct of
  Caulaincourt and Savary in the seizure of the Duc d&#39;Enghien.
  Napoleon, interrupting him, suddenly cried, &quot;This is
  shameful.&quot; He then sent for his will, and interlined the
  following words:&#8212;&quot;I caused the Duc d&#39;Enghien to be
  arrested and tried, because that step was essential to the interest,
  honour, and safety of the French people, when the Count d&#39;Artois
  was maintaining, by his own confession, sixteen assassins in Paris.
  Under similar circumstances I should act in the same way.&quot;
  Having written these few lines he gave back the will. From this
  period he was engaged in writing codicils and appointing executors.
  He gave to Marchand a diamond necklace, valued at 200,000 francs. He
  wound up those transactions by an extraordinary letter,&#8212;no less
  than the form of an announcement of his own death. It was in these
  words:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg
  194]</a></span>&#8212;</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>&quot;Monsieur le Gouverneur, the Emperor Napoleon breathed his
    last on the &#8212;&#8212; after a long and painful illness. I have
    the honour to communicate this intelligence to you.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>&quot;The Emperor had ordered me to communicate, if such be your
    desire, his last wishes. I beg you to inform me, what are the
    arrangements, prescribed by your government for the transportation
    of his remains to France, as well as those relating to the persons
    of his suite. I have the honour to be, &amp;c., <span class=
    'smcap'>Count Montholon</span>.&quot;</p>
  </div>

  <p>An act of this order implied a good deal of self-possession. But,
  even to the last day he continued to occupy his mind with subjects
  sufficiently trying at any period. On one of those nights he made
  Montholon bring a table to his bed-side, and dictated for two hours;
  the subjects being, the decoration of Versailles, and the
  organisation of the National Guard. On the 30th of April he was given
  over by the physicians. On the 3rd of May his fever continued, and
  his mind was evidently beginning to be confused. On the 5th of May he
  passed a very bad night and became delirious. &quot;Twice,&quot; said
  Montholon, &quot;I thought I distinguished the unconnected words,
  <i>France&#8212;ArmÃ©e&#8212;TÃªte
  d&#39;ArmÃ©e&#8212;France</i>.&quot;</p>

  <p>His final hour now visibly approached. From six in the morning,
  until half-past five in the evening of that day, he remained
  motionless, lying on his back, with his right hand out of the bed,
  and his eyes fixed, seemingly absorbed in deep meditation, and
  without any appearance of suffering; his lips were slightly
  contracted; his whole face expressed pleasant and gentle
  impressions.</p>

  <p>But he seems to have been awake to external objects to the last.
  For whenever Antommarchi attempted to moisten his lips, he repulsed
  him with his hand, and fixed his eyes on Montholon, as the only
  person whom he would permit to attend him. At sunset he died.</p>

  <p>The immediate cause of his death was subsequently ascertained by
  the surgeons to have been an extensive ulceration of the stomach.</p>

  <p>On the 9th of May the body was buried with military honours. On
  the 30th, Montholon, with the household, quitted St Helena.</p>

  <p>Thus obscurely, painfully, and almost ignominiously, closed the
  career of the most brilliant, ambitious, and powerful monarch of his
  time. No man had ever attained a higher rank, and sunk from it to a
  lower. No man had ever been so favoured by fortune. No man had ever
  possessed so large an influence over the mind of Europe, and been
  finally an object of hostility so universal. He was the only man in
  history, against whom a Continent in arms pronounced sentence of
  overthrow: the only soldier whose personal fall was the declared
  object of a general war:&#8212;and the only monarch whose capture
  ensured the fall of his dynasty, extinguished an empire, and finished
  the loftiest dream of human ambition in a dungeon.</p>

  <p>Napoleon, since his fall, has been denied genius. But if genius
  implies the power of accomplishing great ends by means beyond the
  invention of others, he was a genius. Every act of his career was a
  superb innovation. As a soldier, he changed the whole art of war.
  Instead of making campaigns of tactics, he made campaigns of
  triumphs. He wasted no time in besieging towns; he rushed on the
  capital. He made no wars of detachments, but threw a colossal force
  across the frontier, held its mass together, and fought pitched
  battles day after day, until he trampled down all resistance by the
  mere weight of a phalanx of 250,000 men. Thus, in 1800, at Marengo,
  he reconquered Italy in twelve hours. In 1805, he broke down Austria
  in a three months&#39; war. In 1806, he crushed the Prussian army in
  four-and-twenty hours, and walked over the monarchy. In 1807, he
  drove the Russians out of Germany, fought the two desperate battles
  of Eylau and Friedland, and conquered that treaty of Tilsit, by which
  he gave the Emperor Alexander a shadow of empire in Asia, in exchange
  for the substance of universal empire in Europe.</p>

  <p>But his time was come. His wars had been wholly selfish. To
  aggrandise his own name, he had covered Europe with blood. To place
  <i>himself</i> at the head of earthly power, he had broken faith with
  Turkey, with Russia, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id=
  "Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>with Germany, and with Spain. The
  blood, the spoil, and the misery of millions were upon his head. His
  personal crimes concentrated the vengeance of mankind upon his
  diadem. For the last three years of his political and military
  existence, he seems to have lain under an actual spell. Nothing but
  the judicial clouding of his intellect can account for the
  precipitate infirmities of his judgment. His march to Russia, as we
  have already observed, was a gigantic absurdity in the eyes of all
  Europe&#8212;his delay at Moscow was a gigantic absurdity in the eyes
  of every subaltern in his army. But his campaigns in France were only
  a continuation of those absurdities. With fifty thousand men he was
  to conquer three hundred thousand, backed by an actual million ready
  to rush into the province of France. How was resistance possible?
  Treaty was his only hope: yet he attempted to resist, and refused to
  treat. He was beaten up to the walls of Paris. The Allies then
  offered him France: he still fought, and only affected to negociate.
  At length the long infatuation was consummated in his march
  <i>from</i> Paris; the Allies marched <i>to</i> Paris; and Napoleon
  was instantly deposed, outlawed, and undone.</p>

  <p>Even his second great experiment for power was but the infatuation
  repeated. Every act was an error: his return from Elba ought to have
  been delayed for at least a year. His campaign of 1815 ought to have
  made head against the Prussians and Germans in the south, while he
  left the English and Prussians to waste their strength against his
  fortresses. Even in Belgium, he ought to have poured the whole mass
  of his army on the English at once, instead of violating his own
  first principle of war, and dividing it into three armies, Ney&#39;s
  at Quatre-Bras, Grouchy&#39;s at Wavre, and his own at Ligny.</p>

  <p>Still, when routed at Waterloo, he had a powerful force in the
  field, the remnant of his army, with Grouchy&#39;s corps. With those
  he ought to have moved on slowly towards Paris, garrisoning the
  fortresses, breaking up the roads, throwing every obstacle in the way
  of the Allies, and finally, at the head of his 60,000 veterans, with
  the national guard of the capital and the surrounding districts,
  (amounting to not less than 100,000 men,) at once making a front
  against the Allies, and negociating.</p>

  <p>Above all things, he ought <i>never</i> to have separated himself
  from the army; as he thus stripped his party of all power at the
  moment, and virtually delivered himself a prisoner to the Bourbonists
  in the capital. Whatever might be the difficulty of deciding on his
  conduct at the time, it is now perfectly easy to see, that all these
  were blunders of the first magnitude, and that every step was direct
  to his ruin.</p>

  <p>He was no sooner in Paris, than he was made a prisoner; escaped
  being shot, only through the mercy of the Allies; and, for the
  general quiet of France and Europe, was consigned, for the remainder
  of his few and melancholy years, to the prison of St Helena.</p>

  <p>The name of Napoleon has a great place in history. He was a great
  moving power of the day of change, a great statesman, a brilliant
  soldier, and a splendid ruler of the mightiest dominion that had
  existed under one sceptre, since the days of Charlemagne. He was a
  man of vast projects, vast means, and vast opportunities. But he had
  no greatness of mind; he had but one purpose, personal
  aggrandizement; and for that purpose, he adopted every vice of the
  heart of man.</p>

  <p>Without being bloodthirsty by nature, he was cruel by habit;
  without being naturally avaricious, he was a universal spoiler; and
  without savagely hating mankind, he spurned the feelings, the
  sufferings, and the life of man. He was hollow, fierce, and
  remorseless, where his own objects were concerned, and whether he
  cheated his party in the state, or rode over a field covered with his
  dying troops, he regarded the treachery as legitimate, and the
  slaughter as meritorious, if they raised him a step nearer to the aim
  of his ambition.</p>

  <p>With the most splendid chances for establishing a name of
  perpetual honour, this selfishness defeated them all. On his
  accession to the throne, he might have secured Peace, as the
  principle of all European government. He might have developed all the
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg
  196]</a></span>natural powers of his empire, covered its rivers with
  commerce, filled its cities with opulence, restored the neglected
  fertility of its plains, and rendered its capital the centre of the
  most brilliant civilisation which the world had ever seen. But War
  was for the <i>fame</i> of Napoleon, and he chose the havoc of
  war.</p>

  <p>In 1812 he might have restored the kingdom of Poland, and stamped
  perpetual renown on his diadem, by an act of imperial justice. But he
  preferred sacrificing it to the alliance of Austria&#8212;for the
  purpose of devastating Russia. He might have exercised his boundless
  influence over Spain, to bring the faculties of that noble country to
  the light, and add the contributions of twelve millions of a
  half-forgotten race of mankind, to the general happiness of the
  world. But he preferred being called its conqueror, shedding its
  blood in torrents. To France herself he might have given a rational
  liberty, have animated her literature, taught common sense to her
  vanity, thrown the field open to her genius, and guided her natural
  ardour, flexibility, and spirit of enterprise, to achievements for
  the good of man, to which all the trophies of the sword are pale. But
  he cast away all those illustrious opportunities, and thought only of
  the shout of the rabble.</p>

  <p>Napoleon&#39;s career was <i>providential</i>; there is no name in
  history, whose whole course bears so palpable a proof of his having
  been created for a <i>historic</i> purpose. Europe, in the partition
  of Poland, had committed a great crime,&#8212;France, in the murder
  of her king, had committed a great crime. The three criminal thrones,
  and the regicidal republic, were alike to be punished. Napoleon was
  the appointed instrument for both purposes. He first crushed the
  democracy, and then he broke the strength of the three powers in the
  field&#8212;he thrice conquered the Austrian capital&#8212;he turned
  Prussia into a province,&#8212;and his march to Russia desolated her
  most populous provinces, and laid her Asiatic capital in ashes.</p>

  <p>But France, which continually paid for all those fearful triumphs
  in her blood, was still to suffer a final and retributive punishment.
  Her armies were hunted from the Vistula to the Rhine, and from the
  Rhine to the Seine. She saw her capital twice captured&#8212;her
  government twice swept away&#8212;her conquests lost&#8212;her
  plunder recovered by its original possessors, and her territory
  garrisoned by an army of strangers&#8212;her army disbanded&#8212;her
  empire cut down to the limits of the old monarchy&#8212;her old
  masters restored, and her idol torn from his altar. Thus were thrown
  away the fruits of the Revolution, of the regicide, of the democracy,
  and of a quarter of a century of wretchedness, fury, and blood.</p>

  <p>On Napoleon himself fell the heaviest blow of all. All the shames,
  sorrows, and sufferings of France were concentered on his head. He
  saw his military power ruined&#8212;his last army
  slaughtered&#8212;his last adherents exiled&#8212;his family
  fugitive,&#8212;his whole dynasty uncrowned, and himself given up as
  a prisoner to England, to be sent to an English dungeon, to be kept
  in English hands; to finish his solitary and bitter existence in
  desertion and disease, and be laid in an English grave,&#8212;leaving
  to mankind perhaps the most striking moral of blasted ambition ever
  given to the world.</p>
  <hr style='width: 45%;' />

  <p>In 1840 England, at the solicitation of France, suffered the
  remains of Napoleon to be brought to Europe. They were received in
  Paris with military pomp, and on the 15th of December were entombed
  in the chapel of the Invalides.</p>

  <h2><a name="JUANCHO_THE_BULL-FIGHTER" id=
  "JUANCHO_THE_BULL-FIGHTER"></a>JUANCHO THE BULL-FIGHTER.</h2>

  <p>M. Theophile Gautier, best known as a clever contributor to the
  critical <i>feuilleton</i> of a leading Paris newspaper, also enjoys
  a respectable reputation as tale-teller and tourist. His
  books&#8212;although for the most part slight in texture, and
  conveying the idea that the author might have done better had he
  taken more pains&#8212;have certain merits of their own. His style,
  sometimes defaced by affectation and pedantry, has a lively smartness
  not unfrequently rising into wit. And in description he is decidedly
  happy. Possessing an artist&#39;s eye, he paints with his pen; his
  colouring is vivid, his outline characteristic. These qualities are
  especially exemplified in a spirited and picturesque, but very
  <i>French</i> narrative, of an extensive ramble in Spain, published
  about four years ago. He has now again drawn upon his Peninsular
  experience to produce a tale illustrative of Spanish life and
  manners, chiefly in the lower classes of society. His hero is a
  bull-fighter, his heroine a <i>grisette</i>. Of bull-fights,
  especially within the last few years, one has heard enough and to
  spare, since every literary traveller in Spain thinks it incumbent on
  him to describe them. But this is the first instance we remember
  where the incidents of the bull-ring, and the exploits and
  peculiarities of its gladiators, are taken as groundwork for a
  romantic tale. The attempt has been crowned with very considerable
  success.</p>

  <p>The construction of M. Gautier&#39;s little romance is simple and
  inartificial, the incidents are spirited, the style is fresh and
  pleasant. Its character is quite Spanish, and one cannot doubt the
  author&#39;s personal acquaintance with the scenes and types he
  sketches&#8212;although here and there he has smoothed down with a
  little French polish the rugged angles of Spanish nationality, and in
  other places he may be accused of melodramatising rather over much.
  Through the varnish which it is the novelist&#39;s privilege to lay
  on with a more or less sparing brush, we obtain many interesting and
  correct glimpses of classes of people whose habits and customs are
  unknown to foreigners, and are likely to continue so, in great
  measure, until the appearance of Spanish writers able and willing to
  depict them. The three principal personages of the tale&#8212;the
  only important ones&#8212;are, a young gentleman of Madrid, a
  bull-fighter named Juancho, and an orphan girl of humble birth and
  great beauty. The story hinges upon the rivalry of the gentleman and
  the <i>torero</i> for the good graces of the grisette. There is a
  secondary plot, associated and partly interwoven with the principal
  one, but which serves little purpose, save that of prolonging a short
  tale into a volume. It will scarcely be necessary to refer to it in
  sketching the trials of the gentle Militona, and the feats and
  misfortunes of the intrepid and unhappy Juancho.</p>

  <p>It was on a June afternoon of the year 184&#8212;that Don AndrÃ©s
  de Salcedo&#8212;a cavalier of good family, competent fortune,
  handsome exterior, amiable character, and four-and-twenty years of
  age&#8212;emerged from a house in the Calle San Bernardo at Madrid,
  where he had passed a wearisome hour in practising a duet of
  Bellini&#39;s with DoÃ±a Feliciana Vasquez de los Rios. This young
  lady, still in her teens, moderately pretty and tolerably rich,
  AndrÃ©s had from childhood been affianced with, and was accustomed to
  consider as his future wife, although his sentiments towards her
  were, in fact, of a very tepid description. Betrothed as children by
  their parents, there was little real love between them: they met
  without pleasure and parted without pain; their engagement was an
  affair of habit, not of the heart.</p>

  <p>It was a <i>dia de toros</i>, as Monday is called in
  Madrid&#8212;that being the day when bull-fights usually take
  place&#8212;and AndrÃ©s, passionately addicted to the Spanish sport,
  left the mansion of his mistress without any lover-like reluctance,
  and hurried to the bull-ring. Through the spacious <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>street
  of Alcala, then crowded to suffocation with vehicles of every
  description, horsemen, and pedestrians, all hurrying to the point of
  grand attraction, the young man pressed onward with that alert and
  active step peculiar to Spaniards&#8212;unquestionably the best
  walkers in the world&#8212;joyfully fingering his ticket of <i>Sombra
  por la tarde</i>.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id=
  "FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class=
  "fnanchor">[11]</a> It entitled him to a place close to the barrier;
  for AndrÃ©s, despising the elegance of the boxes, preferred leaning
  against the ropes intended to prevent the bulls from leaping amongst
  the spectators. Thence each detail of the combat is distinctly seen,
  each blow appreciated at its just value; and in consideration of
  these advantages, AndrÃ©s willingly resigned his elbows to the contact
  of motley-jacketed muleteers, and his curls to the perfume of the
  manolo&#39;s cigar.</p>

  <p>Although a bridegroom-elect ought not, strictly speaking, to
  perceive the existence of other women than his intended, such
  scrupulous fidelity is very rare except in romances: and Don AndrÃ©s,
  albeit descended neither from Don Juan Tenorio nor Don Juan de
  Marana, was led to the circus by other attractions besides the brave
  swordsmanship of Luca Blanco and of MontÃ©s&#39; nephew. At the
  bull-fight on the previous Monday he had seen a young girl of rare
  and singular beauty, whose features had imprinted themselves on his
  memory with a minuteness and indelibility quite extraordinary,
  considering the short time he had been able to observe them. So
  casual a meeting should have left no more trace than the picture to
  which one accords a passing glance. No word or sign had been
  exchanged between AndrÃ©s and the manola, (she apparently belonged to
  that class,) who had been separated by several benches. AndrÃ©s had no
  reason to believe that the young girl had remarked his admiration, or
  even perceived him. Her eyes, fixed upon the arena, had not for an
  instant wandered from the incidents of the bull-fight, in which she
  appeared to take an exclusive interest. It would have been natural to
  forget her on the threshold of the circus; but, instead of that, her
  image had haunted AndrÃ©s all the week, recurring perpetually to his
  memory with increased distinctness and perseverance. And it was a
  vague hope, unacknowledged even to himself, of beholding the lovely
  manola, that now doubled his usual impatience to reach the scene of
  the bull-fight.</p>

  <p>At the very moment AndrÃ©s passed under one of the three arcades of
  the gate of Alcala, a <i>calesin</i>, or light calash, dashed through
  the crowd, amidst a concert of curses and hisses, the usual sounds
  with which the Spanish populace assail whatever deranges them in
  their pleasures, and infringes upon the sovereignty of the
  pedestrian. This vehicle was of outrageous magnificence. The body,
  borne by two enormous scarlet wheels, was covered with groups of
  Cupids, and with Anacreontic attributes, such as lyres, tambourines,
  PandÃ¦an pipes, cooing doves, and hearts pierced with arrows, executed
  at some remote period by a pencil more remarkable for audacity than
  correctness of design. The mule harnessed to this gaudy car, had the
  upper half of his body closely clipped, bore a lofty panoply of
  coloured worsted upon his head, and was covered with bells from nose
  to tail. A ferocious-looking charioteer, stripped to his
  shirt-sleeves, a sheepskin jacket dangling from his shoulder, sat
  sideways upon the shaft, and belaboured with his whip-handle the lean
  flanks of his beast, which sprang forward with redoubled fury at each
  repetition of the stimulant.</p>

  <p>There was nothing remarkable in the appearance of such a vehicle
  on a Monday afternoon at the Alcala gate; and if we have honoured it
  with especial notice, it is because, upon beholding it, the
  countenance of Don AndrÃ©s was illumined by an expression, of the most
  agreeable surprise. The cabriolet contained two persons: one of these
  was a little old woman, in an antiquated black dress, whose
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg
  199]</a></span>gown, too short by an inch, disclosed the hem of one
  of those yellow woolen petticoats commonly worn by Castilian
  peasants. This venerable creature belonged to the class of women
  known in Spain as <i>Tia</i> Pelona, <i>Tia</i> Blasia, according to
  their name, and which answer to the French Mother Michel, Mother
  Godichon, in the society Paul de Kock delights to sketch. Her large,
  black, cadaverous physiognomy was relieved by dark sunken eyes, and
  by a pair of mustaches shading the corners of her lips. Although she
  had long passed the age of coquetry, she arranged her elbows under
  her serge mantilla with an air of no small pretension, and flirted
  with a certain dexterity a large green paper fan. It could hardly be
  the sight of this amiable creature that brought a smile of
  satisfaction across the features of Don AndrÃ©s.</p>

  <p>The second occupant of the cabriolet was a young girl, sixteen or
  eighteen years old&#8212;sixteen rather than eighteen. A black silk
  mantilla, drooping from the top of a tall tortoiseshell comb, round
  which a magnificent plait of hair was twisted, formed a frame to her
  lovely countenance, whose paleness bordered on the olive. Her foot,
  worthy of a Chinese beauty, was extended on the front of the calash,
  showing a delicate satin shoe and a tight silk stocking with coloured
  clocks. One of her hands, slender and well formed, although a little
  sun-burnt, played with the corners of her mantilla, and on the other,
  which held a white handkerchief, sparkled several silver
  rings&#8212;the richest treasures of the manola&#39;s jewel-case.
  Buttons of jet glittered on her sleeve, completing this strictly
  Spanish costume. AndrÃ©s recognised the charming creature whose image
  had haunted him during the whole of the past week. Accelerating his
  pace, he entered the bull-ring at the same time with the two women.
  Chance had so distributed the numbers of the stalls that AndrÃ©s found
  himself seated next to the young manola.</p>

  <p>Whilst the benches of the amphitheatre became rapidly covered with
  spectators, the bull-fighters assembled in a large white-washed
  apartment, serving as a green-room for the actors in the sanguinary
  drama. Amongst these was a man of five or eight-and-twenty, whose
  tawny complexion, jet-black eyes, and crisp curling hair, told of an
  Andalusian origin. A more robust body and better shaped limbs could
  hardly be seen. They exhibited strength and agility combined in the
  happiest proportions. Equally well qualified to run and to wrestle,
  Nature, had she had the express intention of making a bull-fighter,
  could not have succeeded better than when she moulded this slender
  Hercules. Through the opening of his cloak glittered the spangles and
  embroidery of his pink and silver vest, and the jewel of the ring
  that confined the ends of his cravat; this jewel was of considerable
  value, proving, as did the whole of the costume, that its owner
  belonged to the aristocracy of his profession. His <i>mono</i> of new
  ribbons, attached to the lock of hair reserved expressly for that
  purpose, spread in gay profusion over his nape; his montero, of the
  most glossy black, was loaded with silk ornaments of the same colour;
  his pumps, extraordinarily small and thin, would have done honour to
  a shoemaker, and might have served a goddess of the ballet.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, Juancho&#8212;such was the name of the
  torero&#8212;had not the frank, open air of a handsome young fellow
  with gay garments on his back, about to be applauded by a host of
  pretty women. Did apprehension of the approaching contest disturb his
  serenity? Had he seen in his dreams an infernal bull bearing a
  matador empaled upon his horns of red-hot steel? Nothing of the sort.
  This gloomy air was his wont since a twelvemonth. Without being on
  bad terms with his comrades, there no longer existed between him and
  them that jovial and careless familiarity usual amongst persons who
  share the chances of a perilous profession. He did not repulse
  advances, but he made none; and although an Andalusian, he was often
  taciturn. If he at times threw off his melancholy, it was to run into
  the opposite extreme, and abandon himself to a gaiety as violent as
  it was factitious. Then he would drink like a fish, dance like a
  madman, and quarrel about every thing and about nothing. The fit
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg
  200]</a></span>over, he relapsed into his previous moody reserve.</p>

  <p>The hour fixed for the commencement of the sport approached.
  Juancho rose from his bench, threw off his cloak, took his sword, and
  mingled with the motley group of <i>toreros</i> and <i>chulos</i>,
  <i>banderillos</i> and <i>espadas</i>. The cloud had left his brow;
  his eyes sparkled, his nostril was dilated. A singular expression of
  daring animated his fine features. His foot pressed the ground
  energetically, and the nerves of his instep quivered beneath the
  knitted silk like the tense-strings on a guitar-handle. Juancho was
  really a splendid fellow, and his costume wonderfully set off his
  physical perfections. A broad red sash encircled his graceful waist;
  the silver embroideries covering his vest formed, at the collar and
  pockets, and on the sleeves, patches where the groundwork of the
  garment disappeared under the complications of the arabesques. It was
  no longer pink embroidered with silver, but silver embroidered with
  pink. So loaded were the shoulders with twist, filigree, knots and
  ornaments of all kinds, that the arms seemed to issue from two
  crushed crowns. The satin hose, braided and spangled on the seams,
  were admirably adjusted to limbs combining power and elegance. The
  whole dress was the masterpiece of Zapata of Granada,&#8212;of that
  Zapata, unrivalled for <i>majo</i> costumes, who weeps when he takes
  one home, and offers his customer more money to resign it to him than
  he had asked for making it. The learned in such matters did not
  consider the suit dear at ten thousand reals. Worn by Juancho, it was
  worth twenty thousand.</p>

  <p>The last flourish of trumpets sounded; the arena was cleared of
  dogs and boys, and the troop of bull-fighters entered. A murmur of
  admiration greeted Juancho when he made his obeisance before the
  queen&#39;s box; he bent the knee with so good a grace, with an air
  at once, so humble and so proud, and rose again so gracefully and
  easily, that the severest critics and oldest frequenters of the
  circus declared none had ever done it better.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile AndrÃ©s, delighted to have found the manola, paid little
  attention to the preliminaries of the fight, and the first bull had
  already ripped up a horse before he bestowed a single look upon the
  arena. He gazed at the young girl by his side, with an intentness
  that would doubtless have embarrassed her had she perceived it. He
  thought her more charming than ever; and certainly a more perfect
  type of Spanish beauty had never sat upon the blue granite benches of
  the Madrid circus. With admiration amounting to ecstasy, AndrÃ©s
  contemplated the delicate profile, the thin, well-formed nose, with
  nostrils pink-tinted, like the interior of a tropical shell; the full
  temples, where, beneath the slightest possible tint of amber,
  meandered an imperceptible network of blue veins; the mouth, fresh as
  a flower, ripe and ruddy as a fruit, slightly opened by a half smile,
  and illuminated by a gleam of mother-of-pearl; and above all, the
  eyes, whose glances, passing between a thick double fringe of black
  lashes, possessed an irresistible fascination. It was the Greek form
  with the Arab character: the style of beauty would have had something
  startling in a London or Paris drawing-room, but was perfectly in its
  place at a bull-fight and under the ardent sky of Spain.</p>

  <p>The old woman, less attentive than the young one to the progress
  of the sport, watched the proceedings of AndrÃ©s with the look of a
  dog who scents a thief. As he persisted in his contemplation of his
  pretty neighbour, the old lady&#39;s anger gradually increased; she
  fidgeted on her seat, rattled her fan, pushed her companion with her
  elbow, and asked her all sorts of questions to oblige her to turn her
  head. But the young girl either did not or would not understand; she
  gave short answers, and resumed her attentive and serious
  attitude.</p>

  <p>&quot;The devil take the old witch!&quot; muttered AndrÃ©s.
  &quot;Tis a thousand pities they have abolished the Inquisition! With
  such a face as that, she would have been treated, without form of
  trial, to a ride on an ass, dressed in a <i>san-benito</i> and a
  sulphur shirt. She belongs to the seminary of Barahona, and washes
  young girls for the sorcerers&#39; sabbath.&quot;</p>

  <p>Juancho, whose turn to kill had not yet come, stood carelessly in
  the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg
  201]</a></span>centre of the circus, paying no more attention to the
  bulls than if they had been so many sheep. He scarcely deigned to
  take two or three steps aside when the furious beasts showed a
  disposition to attack him. His large bright black eye glanced round
  boxes, galleries, and benches, where thousands of fans, of every hue,
  fluttered and palpitated like butterflies&#39; wings. He evidently
  sought some one. At last a gleam of joy flashed across his brown
  features, and he made the slightest possible movement of his head,
  the sort of salutation that actors sometimes address to their
  acquaintances before the curtain. It was directed to the bench on
  which sat the old woman and the young girl.</p>

  <p>&quot;Militona,&quot; said the duenna in a low voice,
  &quot;Juancho sees us. Be cautious! that young man ogles you, and
  Juancho is jealous.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;What is that to me?&quot; replied Militona in the same
  tone.</p>

  <p>&quot;You know he does not jest with those who displease
  him.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I have not looked at the gentleman, and besides, am I not my
  own mistress?&quot;</p>

  <p>In saying she had not looked at AndrÃ©s, Militona was guilty of a
  slight equivocation. She had not <i>looked</i> at him, perhaps, for
  women can see without looking, but she could have given a most minute
  description of his person. And out of respect to truth, we must here
  mention that she took Don AndrÃ©s de Salcedo for what he really was, a
  very smart and good-looking cavalier.</p>

  <p>AndrÃ©s, as a pretext for commencing a conversation, called one of
  those dealers in oranges, preserved fruits, lozenges, and other
  sweetmeats, who circulate in the corridor of the bull-ring, and offer
  their wares to the spectators at the end of long sticks.</p>

  <p>&quot;SeÃ±orita, will you accept some comfits?&quot; said AndrÃ©s,
  with an engaging smile to his beautiful neighbour, offering her the
  open box.</p>

  <p>The young girl turned quickly round, and looked at him with an air
  of uneasy surprise.</p>

  <p>&quot;They are lemon and mint,&quot; said he, as if to decide
  her.</p>

  <p>Militona, suddenly making up her mind, plunged her little fingers
  into the box, and took a pinch of the lozenges.</p>

  <p>&quot;Luckily Juancho has his back turned,&quot; muttered a
  <i>majo</i> who stood just by, &quot;or there would be blood on his
  knife to-night.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Will this lady take some?&quot; continued AndrÃ©s in a tone
  of exquisite politeness, holding out the box to the horrible old
  woman, who was so disconcerted by this piece of audacity that in her
  confusion she took every one of the sugar-plums. Nevertheless, whilst
  emptying the box into the palm of her hand, black as that of a mummy,
  she cast a furtive and frightened glance at the circus, and heaved an
  enormous sigh.</p>

  <p>At that moment the orchestra sounded the death: it was
  Juancho&#39;s turn to kill. He approached the municipal box, made the
  usual salutation and demand, and threw his montero into the air in
  right cavalier style. The audience, usually so tumultuous, became
  profoundly silent. The bull Juancho had to kill was of formidable
  breed; seven horses, stretched lifeless upon the sand, their bowels
  protruding from hideous wounds, told of his fury and vigour. The two
  picadores had left the arena, sorely bruised and crippled by numerous
  falls, and the supernumerary waited in the corridor, foot in stirrup
  and lance in fist, ready to replace them. The chulos prudently kept
  themselves in the vicinity of the palisade, one foot on the wooden
  ledge which aids them to leap it in case of danger; and the
  victorious bull ranged the circus&#8212;stained here and there by
  large puddles of blood, which the attendants dared not approach to
  scatter with sawdust&#8212;striking the doors with his horns, and
  tossing the dead horses into the air. Juancho approached the
  monstrous beast with that firm and deliberate step before which lions
  themselves retreat. The bull, astonished at sight of a fresh
  adversary, paused, uttered a deep roar, shook the slaver from his
  muzzle, scratched the earth with his hoof, lowered his head two or
  three times, and made a few paces backwards. Juancho was magnificent
  to behold: his countenance expressed dauntless resolution; his fixed
  and steadfast eyes, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id=
  "Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>whose pupils, surrounded by white,
  resembled stars of jet, darted invisible rays which pierced the bull
  like steel darts; unconsciously, he subjected the brute to that
  magnetism by which Van Amburgh sends his trembling tigers crouching
  to the extremity of their den. Each forward step made by the man was
  responded to by a backward one of the ferocious beast. At this
  triumph of moral over brute force, the audience, seized with
  enthusiasm, burst into frantic applause, shouting and stamping,
  yelling out <i>vivas</i>, and ringing the species of bells which
  amateurs take with them to the bull-fights. Walls and ceilings
  cracked beneath this storm of admiration, the paint crumbled off and
  flew about in whirlwinds of white dust. The torero, thus applauded,
  raised his head, with flashing eyes and joyful heart, to the place
  where Militona sat, as if to lay at her feet the admiration of a
  whole city. The moment was badly chosen. Militona had dropped her
  fan, and Don AndrÃ©s, who had snatched it up with all the
  precipitation of a person desirous to strengthen with an additional
  thread the slender chain of a new acquaintance, returned it to her
  with a happy smile and gallant gesture. The young girl could not do
  less than acknowledge the polite attention by a gracious smile and
  inclination of her head. Smile and bow were detected by Juancho; his
  lips grew pale, his complexion green, the orbits of his eyes became
  blood-shot, his hand contracted on his sword-hilt, and the point of
  the weapon, which he held low, was thrust, by a convulsive movement,
  thrice into the sand. The bull, no longer under the spell of the
  fascinating glance, approached his adversary, who neglected to put
  himself on guard. The interval between man and beast was terribly
  small.</p>

  <p>&quot;Master Juancho is not easily frightened,&quot; observed some
  of the more callous spectators.</p>

  <p>&quot;Juancho, have a care!&quot; cried others, more humane;
  &quot;Juancho <i>de mi vida</i>, Juancho of my heart, Juancho of my
  soul, the bull is upon you!&quot;</p>

  <p>As to Militona, whether it was that the habit of bull-fights had
  blunted her sensibility, or that she had entire confidence in the
  consummate skill of Juancho, or because she took little interest in
  the man over whom she exercised such influence, her face continued as
  calm as if nothing unusual was occurring; only a slight flush
  appeared in the centre of her cheek, and the lace of her mantilla
  rose and fell upon her bosom with increased rapidity.</p>

  <p>The cries of the spectators roused Juancho from his stupor: he
  drew hastily back, and waved the scarlet folds of the <i>muleta</i>
  before the eyes of the bull. The instinct of self-preservation, the
  pride of the gladiator, struggled in his breast with the desire to
  watch Militona; a moment&#39;s neglect, a glance on one side, might
  cost him his life. It was an infernal predicament for a jealous man.
  To behold, beside the woman he loved, a gay, handsome, and attentive
  rival, while he, in the middle of a circus, the eyes of twelve
  thousand spectators riveted upon him, had, within a few inches of his
  breast, the sharp horns of a ferocious beast which, under pain of
  dishonour, he could only kill in a certain manner and by a wound in a
  certain place.</p>

  <p>The torero, once more master of the <i>jurisdiction</i>, as it is
  said in tauromachian slang, settled himself firmly on his heels,
  and man&#339;uvred with the muleta to make the bull lower his
  head.</p>

  <p>&quot;What could he say to her,&quot; thought Jauncho, &quot;that
  young fellow on whom she smiled so sweetly?&quot; Swayed by the
  reflection, he again forgot his formidable antagonist, and
  involuntarily raised his eyes. The bull, profiting by the momentary
  inattention, rushed upon the man; the latter, taken unawares, leaped
  backwards, and, by a mechanical movement, made a thrust with his
  sword. Several inches of the blade entered, but in the wrong place.
  The weapon met the bone; a furious movement of the bull made it
  rebound from the wound amidst a spout of blood, and fall to the
  ground some paces off. Juancho was disarmed, and the bull more
  dangerous than ever, for the misdirected thrust had served but to
  exasperate him. The chulos ran to the rescue, waving their pink and
  blue <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg
  203]</a></span>cloaks. Militona grew pale; the old woman uttered
  lamentable ejaculations, and sighed like a stranded whale. The
  public, beholding Juancho&#39;s inconceivable awkwardness, commenced
  one of those tremendous uproars in which the Spanish people excel: a
  perfect hurricane of insulting epithets, of vociferations and
  maledictions. &quot;Away with the dog!&quot; was shouted on all
  sides; &quot;Down with the thief, the assassin! To the galleys with
  him! To Ceuta! The clumsy butcher, to spoil such a noble beast!&quot;
  And so on, through the entire vocabulary of abuse which the Spanish
  tongue so abundantly supplies. Juancho stood erect under the storm of
  insult, biting his lips, and tearing with his right hand the lace
  frills of his shirt. His sleeve, ripped open by the bull&#39;s horn,
  disclosed his arm a long violet scar. For an he tottered, and seemed
  about to fall, suffocated by the violence of his emotions; but he
  promptly recovered himself, ran to his sword, picked it up,
  straightened the bent blade with his foot, and placed himself with
  his back towards the place where Militona sat. At a sign he made, the
  chulos led the bull towards him by tantalising it with their cloaks;
  and this time he dealt the animal a downward thrust, in strict
  conformity with the laws of the sport&#8212;such a one as the great
  MontÃ©s of Chiclana himself would not have disowned. The sword was
  planted between the shoulders, and its cross-hilt, rising between the
  horns of the bull, reminded of those Gothic engravings where St
  Hubert is seen kneeling before a stag which bears a crucifix in its
  antlers.</p>

  <p>The bull fell heavily on its knees before Juancho, as if doing
  homage to his superiority, and after a short convulsion rolled over,
  its four feet in the air.</p>

  <p>&quot;Juancho has taken a brilliant revenge! What a splendid
  thrust! He is superior to Arjona and the Chiclanero; do you not think
  so, SeÃ±orita?&quot; cried AndrÃ©s enthusiastically to his
  neighbour.</p>

  <p>&quot;For God&#39;s sake, sir, not another word!&quot; replied
  Militona very quickly, without turning her head and scarcely moving
  her lips. The words were spoken in a tone at once so imperative and
  so imploring, that AndrÃ©s immediately saw it was not the artifice of
  a young girl begging to be let alone, and hoping to be disobeyed.
  Neither could modesty dictate the injunction. Nothing he had said
  called for such rigour, and manolas, the grisettes of Madrid, are not
  usually&#8212;be it said without calumny&#8212;of such extreme
  susceptibility. Real terror, apprehension of a danger unknown to
  AndrÃ©s, was indicated by the hasty sentence.</p>

  <p>&quot;Can she be a princess in disguise?&quot; said AndrÃ©s to
  himself, considerably puzzled how to act. &quot;If I hold my tongue,
  I shall look like a fool, or, at any rate, like a very middling sort
  of Don Juan: if I persist, I shall perhaps cause the poor girl some
  disagreeable scene. Can she be afraid of the duenna? Hardly. When
  that amiable old sorceress devoured my comfits, she became in some
  sort an accomplice. It cannot be she whom my infanta dreads. Is there
  a father, brother, husband, or jealous lover in the
  neighbourhood?&quot; But on looking around, AndrÃ©s could discover no
  one who seemed to pay the slightest attention to the proceedings of
  the beautiful manola.</p>

  <p>From the moment of the bull&#39;s death till the end of the fight,
  Juancho did not once look at Militona. He despatched with
  unparalleled dexterity two other bulls that fell to his share, and
  was applauded as vehemently as he had previously been hissed. AndrÃ©s,
  either not deeming it prudent, or not finding a good pretext to renew
  the conversation, didn&#39;t speak another word to Militona, and even
  left the circus a few minutes before the conclusion of the
  performances. Whilst stepping across the benches, he whispered
  something to a boy of quick and intelligent physiognomy, and then
  immediately disappeared.</p>

  <p>The boy, when the audience rose to depart, mingled in the crowd,
  and, without any apparent design, attached himself to the steps of
  Militona and the duenna. He saw them get into their cabriolet, and
  when the vehicle rolled away on its great scarlet wheels, he hung on
  behind, as if giving way to a childish impulse, and was whirled
  through a cloud of dust, singing <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>at the top of his voice
  the popular ditty of the Bulls of Puerto.</p>

  <p>&quot;Well done!&quot; exclaimed AndrÃ©s, who, from an alley of the
  Prado, which he had already reached, saw cab and boy rattle past:
  &quot;in an hour I shall know the address of the charming
  manola.&quot;</p>

  <p>AndrÃ©s had reckoned without the chapter of accidents. In the Calle
  de los Desamparados, a cut across the face from the whip of the surly
  <i>calesero</i>, forced the ragged Mercury to let go his hold. Before
  he could pick himself up, and rub the dust and tears from his eyes,
  the vehicle was at the farther end of the street, and although
  Perico, impressed with the importance of his mission, followed it at
  the top of his speed, he lost sight of it in the labyrinth of lanes
  adjacent to the Plaza de Lavapies&#8212;literally, Washfeet
  Square&#8212;a low quarter of Madrid. The most he could ascertain
  was, that the calesin had deposited its burthen in one of four
  streets, but in which of them it was impossible to say. With the bait
  of a dollar before his eyes, however, the urchin was not to be
  discouraged; and late that night, as Don AndrÃ©s was returning from a
  wearisome tertulia, whither he had been compelled to accompany DoÃ±a
  Feliciana de los Rios, he felt a pull at the skirt of his coat. It
  was Perico.</p>

  <p>&quot;Caballero,&quot; said the child, &quot;she lives in the
  Calle del Povar, the third house on the right. I saw her at her
  window, taking in the water jar.&quot;</p>

  <p>It is difficult to describe the style of architecture of the house
  inhabited by Militona, unless we designate it as the order composite.
  Its front was characterised by a total absence of symmetry; the
  walls, sadly out of the perpendicular, seemed about to fall, and
  would doubtless have done so but for the support of sundry iron
  curves and crosses, which held the bricks together, and of two
  adjacent houses of more solid construction. From the lower part of
  the ricketty fabric the plaster had peeled off in large scales,
  exposing the foundation wall; whilst the upper stories, better
  preserved, exhibited traces of old pink paint, as if the poor house
  blushed for shame of its miserable condition. Near the roof of broken
  and disorderly tiles, which marked out a brown festoon against the
  bright blue sky, was a little window, surrounded by a recent coat of
  white plaster. On the right of this casement hung a cage, containing
  a quail: on the left another cage, of minute dimensions, decorated
  with red and yellow beads, served as palace to a cricket. A jar of
  porous earth, suspended by the ears to a string, and covered with a
  pearly moisture, held water cooling in the evening breeze, and from
  time to time allowed a few drops to fall upon two pots of sweet basil
  that stood beneath it. The window was that of Militona&#39;s
  apartment.</p>

  <p>If the reader will venture to ascend with us this dark and broken
  staircase, we will follow Militona as she trips lightly up it on her
  return from the bull-fight; whilst old Aldonsa tolls behind, calling
  upon the saints for succour, and clinging to the greasy rope that
  does duty as a banister. On reaching the topmost landing-place, the
  pretty manola raised a fragment of matting that hung before one of
  those many-panelled doors common in Madrid, took her key and let
  herself in. The interior of the room was humble enough. Whitewash
  replaced paper; a scratched mirror&#8212;which reflected very
  imperfectly the charming countenance of its owner&#8212;a plaster
  cast of St Antony, flanked by two blue glass vases containing
  artificial flowers, a deal table, two chairs, and a little bed
  covered with a muslin quilt, composed the entire furniture. We must
  not forget an image of Our Lady, rudely painted and gilt on glass,
  engravings of the fight of the second of May, of the funeral of Daoiz
  and Velarde, and of a <i>picador</i> on horseback; a tambourine, a
  guitar, and a branch of palm, brought from church on the previous
  Palm Sunday. Such was Militona&#39;s room; and although it contained
  but the barest necessaries of life, it had not the chill and dreary
  look of misery. A cheerful gleam illuminated it; the red brick floor
  was gay and pleasant to the eye; there was no shade on the white
  walls, or cobweb on the raftered roof&#8212;all was fresh, and
  bright, and cheerful in the poor garret. In England it would have
  been perfect destitution, in Spain <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>it was almost comfort,
  and more than was necessary for happiness.</p>

  <p>The old woman was at last at the top of the stairs; she entered
  the room and let herself fall upon one of the two chairs, which
  cracked under her weight. &quot;The water jar, Militona, for
  mercy&#39;s sake! I am half suffocated with the heat and dust; and
  those accursed lozenges have put my throat in a flame.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;You should not have eaten so many, <i>tia</i>,&quot; said
  the young girl, smiling, and placing the jar to the old lady&#39;s
  lips. Aldonsa drank eagerly, passed the back of her hand over her
  mouth, and fanned herself in silence.</p>

  <p>&quot;Talking of lozenges,&quot; said she after a pause, &quot;how
  furiously Juancho looked at us! I am sure he missed the bull because
  that young spark spoke to you. Juancho is jealous as a tiger, and if
  he has fallen in with yonder pretty gentleman, he will have made him
  repent his gallantry. I would not give much for the young man&#39;s
  skin; it will have some famous holes in it. Do you remember the slash
  he gave Luca, for offering you a nosegay at the festival of San
  Isidro?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I hope Juancho will commit no violence,&quot; exclaimed the
  young girl&#8212;&quot;What frightful slavery to be thus persecuted
  by his ferocious love!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;It is your fault,&quot; retorted Aldonsa. &quot;Why are you
  so pretty?&quot;</p>

  <p>A sharp rap at the door, sounding as if given by an iron finger,
  interrupted the conversation. The old woman got up and looked through
  the little grating, inserted, according to Spanish custom, in the
  centre of the door. Through the bars appeared the countenance of
  Juancho, pale beneath the bronzed tint with which the sun of the
  arena had overlaid it. Aldonsa opened the door and the torero
  entered. His features betrayed the violent emotions that had agitated
  him in the bull-ring. To the shame of having been hissed was
  superadded rage at not having quitted the circus soon enough to
  overtake the young man who had been so attentive to Militona. Where
  could he now find him? Doubtless he had followed the manola and
  spoken to her again. And at the thought, Juancho&#39;s hand
  mechanically sank to his girdle to seek his knife.</p>

  <p>The torero sat down upon the second chair. Militona stood at the
  window, pulling a flower to pieces; the old woman fanned herself more
  rapidly than ever: an awkward silence reigned in the apartment.
  Aldonsa was the first to break it.</p>

  <p>&quot;Does your arm hurt you, Juancho?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;No,&quot; replied the bull-fighter, fixing his deep gaze
  upon Militona.</p>

  <p>&quot;You should bandage it, and apply salt and water,&quot; said
  the old woman, determined not to let the conversation drop.</p>

  <p>Juancho made no reply, but addressed himself to Militona.</p>

  <p>&quot;Who was the young man who sat beside you at the
  bull-fight?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I do not know him. I never saw him before.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;But you would like to know him?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;The supposition is polite. Well, and what if I
  should?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I would kill him, the dainty gentleman in polished boots and
  white gloves.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;You talk like a madman, Juancho. What right have I given you
  to be jealous of me? You love me, you say&#8212;is that my fault? Am
  I obliged to adore you, because you have taken it into your head to
  find me pretty?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;True enough,&quot; interposed the old woman, &quot;she is
  not obliged. Nevertheless, you would make a handsome couple. Prettier
  hand never rested on more vigorous arm; and if you danced a cachuca
  together at the garden of the Delicias, people would stand on the
  chairs to look at you.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Have I played the coquet with you, Juancho? Have I sought,
  by word, or look, or smile, to engage your affections?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;No,&quot; replied the torero in a gloomy voice.</p>

  <p>&quot;I never promised you any thing, or gave you any hope: I
  always bade you forget me. Why torment and offend me by your
  unjustifiable violence? You crippled poor Luca, an honest fellow, who
  amused me and made me laugh, and you wounded your friend GinÃ©s almost
  to death, because he happened to touch my hand. Do you <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>think
  such conduct advances you in my good opinion? And to-day at the
  circus you behaved absurdly; whilst watching me, you let the bull
  come upon you, and gave a miserable thrust.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;But I love you, Militona!&quot; exclaimed the bull-fighter
  passionately. &quot;I love you with all my heart and soul; I see but
  you in the world, and a bull&#39;s horn entering my breast would not
  make me turn my head when you smile upon another man. True, my
  manners are not gentle, for I have passed my life in contests with
  savage beasts, in slaying and exposing myself to be slain. I cannot
  be soft and simpering like those delicate young gentlemen who pass
  their time in reading the papers and having their hair curled! But if
  you will not be mine,&quot; resumed Juancho after a pause, striking
  the table violently with his fist, &quot;at any rate no one else
  shall call you his.&quot; And with these words he got up and left the
  room. &quot;I will find him!&quot; he muttered, as he strode down the
  stairs, &quot;and cool his courtship with three inches of
  steel.&quot;</p>

  <p>All that night Juancho kept watch and ward in front of
  Militona&#39;s dwelling, in hopes of falling in with her new admirer.
  Militona learned this from old Aldonsa, who lived in the house, and
  she felt seriously alarmed lest the handsome cavalier who had been so
  courteous to her at the circus, and whom she could not remember
  without a certain interest, should come to harm at the hands of the
  terrible torero who thus tyrannised over her inclinations and scared
  away all aspirants to her favour. Juancho, meanwhile, steady in his
  resolve to exterminate his rival, had betaken himself, on coming off
  guard in the Calle del Povar, to a tailor&#39;s in the Calle Mayor,
  and there had exchanged his usual majo&#39;s dress for a suit of
  black and a round hat. Thus metamorphosed into a sober citizen, he
  passed the day and evening in the Prado, the most elegant
  coffee-houses, the theatres&#8212;in every place, in short, where he
  thought it likely he should meet the object of his anger. But nowhere
  could he find him, and that for the best of reasons. At the very hour
  that the torero purchased the disguise intended to facilitate his
  revenge, Don AndrÃ©s, in the back shop of a clothes-dealer on the
  Rastro&#8212;the great Madrid market for second-hand articles of
  every description&#8212;donned the complete costume of a manolo,
  trusting it would aid him in his designs upon Militona. Equipped in a
  round jacket of snuff-coloured cloth, abundantly decorated with small
  buttons, in loose pantaloons, a silk sash, a dark cloak and
  velvet-trimmed hat, which garments, although not quite new, were not
  wanting in a certain elegance, and sat trimly upon his well-made
  person, AndrÃ©s hurried to the Calle del Povar. He at once recognised
  the window described to him by Perico; a curtain was drawn before it
  on the inner side, and nothing indicated that the room had an
  occupant.</p>

  <p>&quot;Doubtless she is gone out,&quot; thought AndrÃ©s, &quot;and
  will return only when her day&#39;s work is finished. She must be a
  needle-woman, cigar-maker, embroideress, or something of that
  kind,&quot; and he walked on.</p>

  <p>Militona had not gone out. She was cutting out a dress upon her
  little table. The occupation required no great mystery, but
  nevertheless her door was bolted, for fear probably of some sudden
  invasion on the part of Juancho, rendered doubly dangerous by the
  absence of Tia Aldonsa. As she worked, Militona&#39;s thoughts
  travelled faster than her needle. They ran upon the young man who had
  gazed at her the previous evening, at the circus, with so tender and
  ardent a gaze, and who had spoken a few words to her in a voice that
  still sounded pleasantly in her ear.</p>

  <p>It was night, and Juancho, straitened and uncomfortable in his
  modern costume, and wearied with fruitless researches, paced the
  alleys of the Prado with hasty steps, looking every man in the face,
  but without discovering his rival. At the same hour, AndrÃ©s, seated
  in an <i>orchateria de chufas</i> (orgeat-shop) nearly opposite
  Militona&#39;s house, quietly consumed a glass of iced lemonade. He
  had placed himself on picket there, with Perico for his vedette.
  Juancho would have passed him by without recognising him, or thinking
  of seeking his enemy under the round jacket and <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>felt
  hat of a manolo, but Militona, concealed in the corner of her window,
  had not been deceived for an instant by the young man&#39;s disguise.
  Love has sharper eyes than hatred. Devoured by anxiety, the manola
  asked herself what could be the projects of the persevering cavalier,
  and dreaded the terrible scene that must ensue should Juancho
  discover him. AndrÃ©s, his elbows upon the table, watched every one
  who went in or out of the house; but night came and Militona had not
  appeared. He began to doubt the correctness of his emissary&#39;s
  information, when a light in the young girl&#39;s window showed that
  the room was inhabited. Hastily writing a few words in pencil on a
  scrap of paper, he called Perico, who lingered in the neighbourhood,
  and bade him take the billet to the pretty manola. Perico slipped
  into the house, fumbled his way up stairs, and discovered
  Militona&#39;s door by the light shining through the cracks. Two
  discreet taps; the wicket was half opened, and the note taken in.</p>

  <p>&quot;It is to be hoped she can read,&quot; thought AndrÃ©s, as he
  paid for his lemonade, left the shop, and walked slowly up and down
  the street. This was what he had written:&#8212;</p>

  <p>&quot;One who cannot forget you, and who would grieve to do so,
  ardently desires to see you again; but after your last words at the
  circus, and ignorant of your position, he fears to place you in peril
  by seeking an interview. Danger to himself would be no obstacle.
  Extinguish your lamp, and throw your answer from the
  window.&quot;</p>

  <p>In a few minutes the lamp disappeared, the window opened, and
  Militona took in her water-jar. In so doing she upset one of the pots
  of sweet basil, which fell into the street and was broken to pieces.
  Amidst the brown earth scattered upon the pavement, something white
  was visible. It was Militona&#39;s answer. AndrÃ©s called a
  <i>sereno</i>, or watchman, who just then passed, with his lantern at
  the end of his halbert, and begging him to lower the light, read the
  following words, written in a tremulous hand, and in large irregular
  letters:&#8212;</p>

  <p>&quot;Begone instantly.... I have no time to say more. To morrow,
  at ten o&#39;clock, in the church of San Isidro. For Heaven&#39;s
  sake begone! your life is at stake.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Thank you, my good man,&quot; said AndrÃ©s, putting a real
  into the sereno&#39;s hand, &quot;you may go.&quot;</p>

  <p>The street was quite deserted, and AndrÃ©s was walking slowly away,
  when the apparition of a man, wrapped in a cloak, beneath which the
  handle of a guitar formed an acute angle, excited his curiosity, and
  he stepped into the dark shadow of a low archway. The man threw back
  the folds of his cloak, brought his guitar forward, and began that
  monotonous thrumming which serves as accompaniment to serenades and
  seguidillas. The object of this prelude evidently was to awaken the
  lady in whose honour it was perpetrated; but Militona&#39;s window
  continued closed and dark; and at last the man, compelled to content
  himself with an invisible auditory,&#8212;in spite of the Spanish
  proverb, which says, no woman sleeps so soundly that the twang of a
  guitar will not bring her to the window,&#8212;began to sing in a
  strong Andalusian accent. The serenade consisted of a dozen verses,
  in which the singer celebrated the charms of a cruel mistress, vowed
  inextinguishable love, and denounced fearful vengeance upon all
  rivals. The menaces, however, were far more abundant, in this rude
  ditty, than the praises of beauty or protestations of affection.</p>

  <p>&quot;<i>Caramba</i>!&quot; thought AndrÃ©s, when the song
  concluded, &quot;what ferocious poetry! Nothing tame about those
  couplets. Let us see if Militona is touched by the savage strain.
  This must be the terrible lover by whom she is so frightened. She
  might be alarmed at less.&quot;</p>

  <p>Don AndrÃ©s advanced his head a little; a moonbeam fell upon it,
  and Juancho&#39;s quick eye detected him. &quot;Good!&quot; said
  AndrÃ©s to himself, &quot;I am caught. Now then, cool and
  steady.&quot;</p>

  <p>Juancho threw down his guitar, which resounded mournfully on the
  pavement, and ran up to AndrÃ©s, whose face was now in the full
  moonlight, and whom he at once recognised.</p>

  <p>&quot;What do you here at this hour?&quot; <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>said
  the bull-fighter, in a voice that trembled with passion.</p>

  <p>&quot;I listen to your music; it is a refined amusement.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;If you listened, you heard that I allow no one to set foot
  in this street when I sing.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I am naturally very disobedient,&quot; replied AndrÃ©s, with
  perfect coolness.</p>

  <p>&quot;You will change your character to-day.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Certainly not&#8212;I am attached to my habits.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Defend yourself, then, or die!&quot; cried Juancho, drawing
  his knife, and rolling his cloak round his arm. His movements were
  imitated by AndrÃ©s, who placed himself on guard with a promptness
  that showed knowledge of the weapon, and somewhat surprised the
  bull-fighter. AndrÃ©s had long practised the <i>navaja</i> under one
  of the best teachers in Seville, as at Paris one sees young men of
  fashion take lessons of <i>savate</i> and singlestick, reduced to
  mathematical principles by Lecourt and Boucher.</p>

  <p>Juancho hovered about his adversary, advancing his left arm,
  protected by numerous folds of cloth, as a buckler, his right drawn
  back to give more swing and force to the blow; now stooping with
  knees bent, then rising up like a giant, and again sinking down like
  a dwarf; but the point of his knife was always met by the cloaked arm
  of AndrÃ©s. Alternately retreating and suddenly and impetuously
  attacking, he sprang right and left, balancing his blade on his hand,
  as though about to hurl it at his foe. AndrÃ©s replied several times
  to these varied attacks by such rapid and well-directed thrusts, that
  a less adroit combatant than Juancho would hardly have parried them.
  It was truly a fine fight, and worthy a circle of spectators learned
  in the art; but, unfortunately, the windows were all closed, and the
  street was empty. Academicians of San Lucar, of the Potro of Cordova,
  of the Albaycin of Granada, and of the <i>barrio</i> of
  Triana,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> why were ye not there to
  witness the doughty deeds of those valiant champions?</p>

  <p>The two champions, vigorous though they were, grew fatigued with
  such violent exertions; the sweat streamed from their temples, their
  breasts heaved like the bellows of a forge, their feet were heavier
  on the ground, their movements less elastic. Juancho felt the point
  of AndrÃ©s&#39; knife pierce his sleeve, and his rage redoubled; with
  a desperate bound, and at risk of his life, he sprang, like a
  panther, upon his enemy. AndrÃ©s fell backwards, and, in his fall,
  burst open the imperfectly-fastened door of Militona&#39;s house, in
  front of which the duel occurred. Juancho walked quietly away. The
  <i>sereno</i>, who just then passed the end of the street, uttered
  his monotonous cry;&#8212;&quot;<i>Las once y media, y
  sereno.</i>&quot;<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id=
  "FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class=
  "fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

  <p>In an agony of anxiety, Militona had listened from her window to
  the noise of this conflict; she would have called for help, but her
  tongue clove to her palate, and terror compressed her throat with its
  iron fingers. At last, half frantic, and unconscious of what she did,
  she staggered downstairs, and reached the door just as it was forced
  open by the weight of AndrÃ©s&#39; inanimate body.</p>

  <p>The next morning, soon after day-break, when the torero, in cloak
  and slouched hat, walked into the neighbourhood of the Plaza de
  Lavapies to hear what was said of the night&#39;s events, he learned,
  to his intense horror, that AndrÃ©s, severely but not mortally
  wounded, had been conveyed to Militona&#39;s room, and placed in her
  bed, where he now lay, carefully tended by the manola, of whose
  humane and charitable conduct the gossips of the quarter were loud in
  praise. When Juancho heard this, his knees shook, and he was forced
  to support himself against the wall. His rival in the chamber, and on
  the bed, of Militona! He could scarcely refrain from rolling on the
  ground, and tearing his breast with his nails. Recovering himself, he
  entered the house and ascended the stairs with a heavy and
  sinister-sounding step. &quot;In her chamber! In her chamber!&quot;
  he muttered. And, as he spoke, he instinctively <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>opened
  and shut his long Albacete knife. On reaching the top of the stairs,
  he knocked violently at the manola&#39;s door.</p>

  <p>AndrÃ©s started on his bed of suffering; Militona, who was seated
  near him, turned deadly pale, and rose to her feet as if impelled by
  springs. Tia Aldonsa looked horribly frightened, and devoutly crossed
  herself. The blow was so imperative as to command attention; a
  repetition of the summons would have forced the door from its hinges.
  With trembling hand Aldonsa opened the wicket, and beheld
  Juancho&#39;s face at the aperture. Medusa&#39;s mask, livid amidst
  its grim and snaky locks, could hardly have produced a more terrible
  effect upon the poor old woman. Speechless and petrified, she stood
  with fixed eyeballs, open mouth, and hands extended. True it was,
  that the torero&#39;s head, seen through the grating, had no very
  amiable and encouraging aspect; his eyes were injected with blood;
  his face was livid, and his cheek-bones, whence the usual ruddy tinge
  had fled, formed two white spots in his cadaverous countenance; his
  distended nostrils palpitated like those of ferocious beasts that had
  scent of a prey; his teeth were pressed upon his lip, which was
  swollen and bloody from the bite. Jealousy, fury, and revenge had set
  their stamp on his distorted features.</p>

  <p>&quot;Blessed Lady of Almudena!&quot; muttered the old woman,
  &quot;deliver us from this peril, and I promise you a wax taper with
  a velvet handle.&quot;</p>

  <p>Courageous as he was, AndrÃ©s experienced that uneasy feeling to
  which the bravest men are subject when exposed to a danger against
  which they are defenceless. He mechanically extended his hand to seek
  some weapon.</p>

  <p>As nobody opened the door, Juancho applied his shoulder to it and
  gave a push; the planks cracked, and the plaster crumbled from round
  the lock and hinges. Then Militona, placing herself before AndrÃ©s,
  said in a calm and firm voice to the old woman, who was half crazed
  with terror:</p>

  <p>&quot;Aldonsa, open the door; I insist upon it.&quot;</p>

  <p>Aldonsa drew the bolt, and, standing close to the wall, pulled the
  door back upon her for protection, like a helot letting a tiger into
  the arena, or a servant admitting into the bull-ring some furious
  native of Gaviria or Colmenar. Juancho, who expected more resistance,
  entered slowly, as if disconcerted by the absence of obstacles. But a
  single glance at AndrÃ©s, stretched in Militona&#39;s bed, brought
  back all his fury. He seized the door, to which Tia Aldonsa, who
  thought her last hour come, clung with all her might, and shutting it
  in spite of the poor old woman&#39;s efforts, placed his back against
  it and crossed his arms upon his breast.</p>

  <p>&quot;Angels of heaven!&quot; muttered Aldonsa, her teeth
  chattering with terror, &quot;he will murder us all three. I will
  call out of the window.&quot;</p>

  <p>And she made a step in that direction. But Juancho, guessing her
  intention, seized her by the gown, and with a single jerk replaced
  her against the wall, her skirt half torn off.</p>

  <p>&quot;Hag!&quot; he cried, &quot;if you attempt to call out, I
  will twist your neck like a fowl&#39;s, and send your old soul to the
  devil. Come not between me and the object of my wrath, or I crush you
  on my path.&quot;</p>

  <p>And he pointed to AndrÃ©s, who, pale and feeble, in vain
  endeavoured to raise his head from the pillow. It was a horrible
  situation. No noise had been made that could alarm the neighbours,
  who, moreover, would have been more likely to lock themselves in
  their rooms for fear of Juancho, than to render assistance. There
  were no means of apprising the police, or obtaining succour from
  without. Poor AndrÃ©s, severely wounded, weak from loss of blood,
  without arms, and unable to use them had he had any, lay at the mercy
  of a ruffian intoxicated with rage and jealousy. All this because he
  had ogled a pretty manola at a bull-fight. It is allowable to suppose
  that at that moment he regretted the tea-table, piano, and prosaic
  society of DoÃ±a Feliciana de los Rios. Nevertheless, on casting a
  supplicatory glance at Militona, as if to implore her not to risk her
  safety in his defence, he found her so marvellously lovely in her
  pallor and emotion, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id=
  "Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>that he could not think her
  acquaintance dearly purchased even by this great peril. She stood
  erect, one hand on the edge of AndrÃ©s&#39; bed, whom she seemed
  resolved to protect, the other extended towards the door with a
  gesture of supreme majesty.</p>

  <p>&quot;What do you here, murderer?&quot; she cried, in clear and
  thrilling tones. &quot;You sought a lover; you find a wounded and
  helpless man. Begone! Fear you not lest the wound break out afresh at
  your presence? Are you not sick of bloodshed? Do you come as an
  assassin?&quot;</p>

  <p>The young girl accentuated the last word in so singular a manner,
  and accompanied it with so piercing and terrible a look, that Juancho
  was embarrassed, reddened, turned pale, and the ferocity of his
  countenance was exchanged for an expression of uneasiness. After a
  pause, he spoke in a choked and faltering voice.</p>

  <p>&quot;Swear, by the relics of Monte Sagrado, and by the image of
  the Virgin del Pilar, by your dead father, and your sainted mother,
  that you do not love this man, and I instantly depart.&quot;</p>

  <p>AndrÃ©s awaited Militona&#39;s reply with intense anxiety. She made
  none. Her long black lashes drooped over her cheek, which was
  suffused with a faint tinge of pink. Although this silence was
  perhaps his doom to death, AndrÃ©s felt his heart leap with joy.</p>

  <p>&quot;If you will not swear,&quot; continued Juancho, &quot;affirm
  it. I will believe you; you have never lied. But if you keep silence,
  I must kill him.&quot; And he approached the bed with uplifted
  knife.</p>

  <p>&quot;You love him?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes!&quot; exclaimed the young girl, with flashing eyes and
  a voice trembling with passion and indignation. &quot;I love him. If
  he dies on my account, let him know at least that he is beloved. Let
  him carry to his grave that word, his consolation and your
  torture.&quot;</p>

  <p>With a bound, Juancho stood beside Militona, whose arm he rudely
  grasped.</p>

  <p>&quot;Do not repeat it,&quot; he exclaimed, &quot;or I throw you,
  with my knife in your heart, upon the body of your minion.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;What care I!&quot; cried the courageous girl. &quot;Think
  you I will live, if he dies?&quot;</p>

  <p>AndrÃ©s made a desperate effort to raise himself. He endeavoured to
  call out; a reddish foam rose to his lips&#8212;his wound had opened.
  He fell back senseless upon his pillow.</p>

  <p>&quot;If you do not depart,&quot; cried Militona to the torero,
  &quot;I hold you vile, base, and a coward. I believe all that has
  been said of you; I believe that you could have saved Domingues when
  the bull knelt upon his breast, and that you would not, because you
  were meanly jealous of him.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Militona! Militona! you have a right to hate me, although
  never did man love woman as I love you; but you have no right to
  despise me. No human power could save Domingues.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;If you would not have me think you an assassin,
  depart!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes, I will wait till he is cured,&quot; replied Juancho, in
  a gloomy tone.&#8212;&quot;Take good care of him. I have sworn, that
  whilst I live, no man shall call you his.&quot;</p>

  <p>During this stormy scene, old Aldonsa had slipped out to sound an
  alarm in the neighbourhood. Five or six men now rushed into the room,
  seized Juancho and dragged him out with them. But on the
  landing-place he shook them from him, as a bull shakes off a pack of
  dogs, and forcing his way through all opposition, reached the street
  and was lost to view in the maze of buildings that surrounds the
  Plaza de Lavapies.</p>

  <p>The friends of Don AndrÃ©s de Salcedo, uneasy at his disappearance,
  had already applied to the police to obtain news of his fate.
  Researches were made, and Argamasilla and Covachuelo, two of the most
  wily alguazils of the secret police, at last succeeded in ferreting
  out traces of the missing cavalier. Orders were given to arrest
  Juancho the bull-fighter, on a charge of assassination. But the
  Madrid police are not very celebrated for courage and decision, and
  the two thief-catchers above named, to whom the execution of the
  warrant was intrusted, proceeded on their mission with infinite
  delicacy, awed by the notorious strength and fierceness of the
  torero. Evil tongues were ready to assert that they took considerable
  pains not to meet with the man for whose capture they affected to be
  anxious. At last, however, a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211"
  id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>clumsy spy reported to them that the
  object of their timid researches had just entered the circus with as
  calm an air as if he had no crime upon his conscience, or fear of the
  arm of justice. Argamasilla and Covachuelo could no longer evade the
  performance of their duty, and were compelled to betake themselves to
  the place pointed out.</p>

  <p>The unwelcome information was correct. Juancho had gone to the
  circus,&#8212;driven thither by the force of habit rather than by any
  interest in the sport that had once engrossed his thoughts and
  energies. Since the terrible scene in Militona&#39;s room had
  convinced him she loved another, his courage and energy seemed to
  have deserted him. He was morose, listless, and indifferent to every
  thing. Nevertheless he had instinctively wandered down to the
  bull-ring, to look at some remarkably fine beasts that had been
  brought to the stable for the next day&#39;s fight. He was still
  there, and was walking across the arena, when Argamasilla and
  Covachuelo arrived with a little squad of assistants, and Covachuelo,
  with infinite ceremony and courtesy, informed Juancho that he was
  under the painful necessity of conducting him to prison. Juancho
  shrugged his shoulders contemptuously and walked on. The alguazil
  made a sign, and two men laid hands upon the torero, who brushed them
  away as though they had been flies upon his sleeve. The whole band
  then precipitated themselves upon him; he struggled furiously, and
  knocked them about like nine-pins, but, sensible that he must at last
  be overpowered by numbers, he managed gradually to get near the
  <i>toril</i>,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id=
  "FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class=
  "fnanchor">[14]</a> and then, shaking off his assailants by a sudden
  effort, he opened the door, and took refuge in that dangerous asylum.
  His enemies endeavoured to follow him, but whilst they tried to force
  the door, it suddenly flew open, and a bull, hunted from his stall by
  Juancho, dashed with lowered horns and dreadful bellow amongst the
  terrified troop. The poor devils had but just time to climb the
  barriers, and one of them only escaped with a terrible rent in his
  lower garments.</p>

  <p>This daring proceeding of the besieged greatly disconcerted the
  besiegers. Nevertheless they plucked up courage, and, after a while,
  ventured to return to the charge. This time two bulls rushed out, and
  as the police dispersed and got away with all the agility of fear,
  the wild animals, seeing no human foes, turned their wrath against
  each other, crossed their horns, and with muzzles in the dust of the
  circus, made furious efforts for mastery.</p>

  <p>&quot;Comrade,&quot; cried Covachuelo to Juancho, &quot;we know
  the extent of your ammunition. You have still five bulls to let off;
  after that you will be compelled to surrender unconditionally. If you
  capitulate and come out at once, I will take you to prison with due
  regard for your feelings, without handcuffs, in a coach at your own
  expense, and will say nothing in my report of the resistance you have
  made, which would aggravate your case.&quot;</p>

  <p>Juancho, careless about his liberty, ceased his defence, and gave
  himself up to Argamasilla and Covachuelo, who took him to prison with
  all the honours of war.</p>

  <p>The torero&#39;s case was a bad one. The public prosecutor
  represented the nocturnal combat as an attempted assassination.
  Fortunately AndrÃ©s, whom a good constitution and Militona&#39;s
  unremitting care speedily restored to health, interceded for him,
  representing the affair as a duel, fought with an unusual weapon
  certainly, but with one which he could accept, because he was
  acquainted with its management. The generous young man, happy in
  Militona&#39;s love, thought poor Juancho had suffered sufficiently
  on his account, without being sent to the galleys for a wound now
  perfectly healed. AndrÃ©s held his present happiness cheaply bought at
  the price of a stab. And as a murder can hardly be very severely
  punished, when the victim is in perfect health and pleads for his
  assassin, the result of Salcedo&#39;s mediation, and of the interest
  he made, was the release of Juancho, who left his prison with the
  bitter regret of owing his liberty to the man he most hated upon
  earth, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg
  212]</a></span>and from whom he would sooner have died than receive a
  favour.</p>

  <p>&quot;Unhappy wretch that I am!&quot; he exclaimed, when he once
  more found himself unfettered and in sunshine. &quot;Henceforward, I
  must hold this man&#39;s life sacred, or deserve the epithet of
  coward and villain. Oh! I would a thousand times have preferred the
  galleys! In ten years I should have returned and could have revenged
  myself.&quot;</p>

  <p>From that day Juancho disappeared. It was said that he had been
  seen galloping on his famous black horse in the direction of
  Andalusia. Be that as it might, he was no more seen in Madrid.</p>

  <p>The departure of the bull-fighter was shortly followed by the
  marriage of AndrÃ©s and Militona, AndrÃ©s having been released from his
  previous engagement with DoÃ±a Feliciana de los Rios, who had
  discovered, during his illness, that she had in fact very little
  affection for her betrothed husband, and had encouraged the
  attentions of a rich English traveller. The double marriage took
  place on the same day and in the same church. Militona had insisted
  on making her own wedding dress; it was a masterpiece, and seemed cut
  out of the leaves of a lily. It was so well made, that nobody
  remarked it. Feliciana&#39;s dress was extravagantly rich. When they
  came out of church, every body said of Feliciana, &quot;What a lovely
  gown!&quot; and, of Militona, &quot;What a charming person!&quot;</p>

  <p>Two months had elapsed, and Don AndrÃ©s de Salcedo and his lady
  lived in retirement at a delicious country villa near Granada. With
  good sense that equalled her beauty, Militona refused to mix in the
  society to which her marriage elevated her, until she should have
  repaired the deficiencies of an imperfect education. The departure of
  a friend for the Manillas, compelled her husband to visit Cadiz, and
  she accompanied him. They found the Gaditanos raving of a torero who
  performed prodigies of skill and courage. Such temerity had never
  before been witnessed. He gave out that he came from Lima in South
  America, and was then engaged at Puerto-de-Santa-Maria. Thither
  Andre&#39;s, who felt his old tauromachian ardour revive at the
  report of such prowess, persuaded his wife to accompany him, and at
  the appointed hour they took their places in a box at the circus. On
  all sides they heard praises of this famous torero. His incredible
  feats were in every body&#39;s mouth, and all declared that if he was
  not killed, he would very soon eclipse the fame of the great MontÃ©s
  himself.</p>

  <p>The fight began, and the torero made his appearance. He was
  dressed in black; his vest, garnished with ornaments of silk and jet,
  had a sombre richness harmonizing with the wild and almost sinister
  countenance of its wearer; a yellow sash was twisted round his meagre
  person, which seemed composed solely of bone and muscle. His dark
  countenance was traversed by furrows, traced, as it seemed, rather by
  the hand of care than by lapse of years; for although youth had
  disappeared from his features, middle age had not yet set its stamp
  upon them. There was something in the face and figure of the man
  which AudrÃ©s thought he remembered; but he could not call to mind
  when or where he had seen him. Militona, on the other hand, did not
  doubt for an instant. In spite of his small resemblance to his former
  self, she at once recognised Juancho.</p>

  <p>The terrible change wrought in so short a time had something that
  alarmed her. It proved how terrible was the passion that had thus
  played havoc with this man of iron frame.</p>

  <p>Hastily opening her fan to conceal her face, she said to AndrÃ©s in
  a hurried voice:</p>

  <p>&quot;It is Juancho.&quot;</p>

  <p>But her movement was too late; the torero had seen her; with his
  hand he waved a salutation.</p>

  <p>&quot;Juancho it really is!&quot; cried AndrÃ©s; &quot;the poor
  fellow is sadly changed; he has grown ten years older. Ah! <i>he</i>
  is the new torero, of whom they talk so much: he has returned to the
  bull-ring.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Let us go, AndrÃ©s,&quot; said Militona to her husband.
  &quot;I know not why, but I am very uneasy; I feel sure something
  will happen.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;What can happen,&quot; replied An<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>drÃ©s,
  &quot;except the death of horses and the fall of a few
  picadores?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I fear lest Juancho should commit some
  extravagance,&#8212;some furious act.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;You cannot forget that unlucky stab, or lucky one, I should
  rather call it, since to it I owe my present happiness.&quot; And
  AndrÃ©s tenderly pressed the hand of his bride, to whose cheeks the
  blood that for an instant had left them, now began to return.
  &quot;If you knew Latin&#8212;which you fortunately do not&#8212;I
  would tell you that the law of <i>non bis in idem</i> guarantees my
  safety. Besides the honest fellow has had time to calm
  himself.&quot;</p>

  <p>Juancho performed prodigies. He behaved as if invulnerable; took
  bulls by the tail and made them waltz, put his foot between their
  horns and leaped over them, tore off the ribbons with which they were
  adorned, planted himself right in their path and harassed them with
  unparalleled audacity. The delighted spectators were outrageous in
  their applause, and swore that such a bull-fight had never been
  witnessed since the days of the Cid Campeador. The other
  bull-fighters, electrified by the example of their chief, seemed
  equally reckless of danger. The picadores advanced to the very centre
  of the circus, the banderillos drove their darts into the flanks of
  the bull without once missing. When any of them were hard pressed,
  Juancho was ever at hand, prompt to distract the attention of the
  furious beast, and draw its anger on himself. One of the chulos fell,
  and would have been ripped from navel to chin, had not Juancho, at
  risk of his life, forced the bull from its victim. Every thrust he
  gave was delivered with such skill and force that the sword entered
  exactly between the shoulders, and disappeared to the hilt. The bulls
  fell at his feet as though struck by lightning, and a second blow was
  never once required.</p>

  <p>&quot;<i>Caramba</i>!&quot; exclaimed AndrÃ©s, &quot;Montes, the
  Chiclanero, Arjona, Labi, and the rest of them, had better take care;
  Juancho will excel them all, if he has not done so already.&quot;</p>

  <p>But such exploits as these were not destined to be repeated;
  Juancho attained that day the highest sublimity of the art; he did
  things that will never be done again. Militona herself could not help
  applauding; AndrÃ©s was wild with delight and admiration; the delirium
  was at its height; frantic acclamations greeted every movement of
  Juancho.</p>

  <p>The sixth bull was let into the arena.</p>

  <p>Then an extraordinary and unheard-of thing occurred: Juancho,
  after playing the bull and mano&#339;uvring his cloak with consummate
  dexterity, took his sword, and, instead of plunging it into the
  animal&#39;s neck, as was expected, hurled it from him with such
  force, that it turned over and over in the air, and stuck deep in the
  ground at the other end of the circus.</p>

  <p>&quot;What is he about,&quot; was shouted on all sides. &quot;This
  is madness&#8212;not courage! What new scheme is this? Will he kill
  the bull with his bare hands?&quot;</p>

  <p>Juancho cast one look at Militona&#8212;one ineffable look of love
  and suffering. Then he remained motionless before the bull. The beast
  lowered its head. One of its horns entered the breast of the man, and
  came out red to the very root. A shriek of horror from a thousand
  voices rent the sky.</p>

  <p>Militona fell back upon her chair in a deathlike swoon.</p>

  <h3>A REMINISCENCE OF THE CIRCUIT.</h3>

  <h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

  <p>&quot;Hallo, Tom! Are you not up yet? Why, man, the judges have
  gone down to the court half an hour ago, escorted by the most ragged
  regiment of ruffians that ever handled a Lochaber-axe.&quot;</p>

  <p>Such was my matutinal salutation to my friend Thomas Strachan, as
  I entered his room on a splendid spring morning. Tom and I were early
  college allies. We had attended, or rather, to speak more correctly,
  taken out tickets for the different law classes during the same
  sessions. We had fulminated together within the walls of the
  Juridical Society on legal topics which might have broken the heart
  of Erskine, and rewarded ourselves diligently thereafter with the
  usual relaxations of a crab and a comfortable tumbler. We had
  aggravated the same grinder with our deplorable exposition of the
  Pandects, and finally assumed, on the same day, the full-blown
  honours of the Advocate&#39;s wig and gown. Nor did our fraternal
  parallel end there: for although we had walked the boards of the
  Parliament House with praiseworthy diligence for a couple of
  sessions, neither of us had experienced the dulcet sensation which is
  communicated to the palm by the contact of the first professional
  guinea. In vain did we attempt to insinuate ourselves into the good
  graces of the agents, and coin our intellects into such jocular
  remarks, as are supposed to find most favour in the eyes of facetious
  practitioners. In vain did I carry about with me, for a whole week,
  an artificial process most skilfully made up; and in vain did Tom
  compound and circulate a delectable ditty, entitled, &quot;The Song
  of the Multiplepoinding.&quot; Not a single solicitor would listen to
  our wooing, or even intrust us with the task of making the simplest
  motion. I believe they thought me too fast, and Tom too much of a
  genius: and, therefore, both of us were left among the ranks of the
  briefless army of the stove. This would not do. Our souls burned
  within us with a noble thirst for legal fame and fees. We held a
  consultation (without an agent) at the Rainbow, and finally
  determined that since Edinburgh would not hear us, Jedburgh should
  have the privilege of monopolising our maiden eloquence at the
  ensuing justiciary circuit. Jedburgh presents a capital field to the
  ambition of a youthful advocate. Very few counsel go that way; the
  cases are usually trifling, and the juries easily bamboozled. It has
  besides this immense advantage&#8212;that should you by any accident
  happen to break down, nobody will in all probability be the wiser for
  it, provided you have the good sense to ingratiate yourself with the
  circuit-clerk.</p>

  <p>Tom and I arrived at Jedburgh the afternoon before the circuit
  began. I was not acquainted with a human being within the
  parliamentary boundaries of that respectable borough, and therefore
  experienced but a slight spasm of disappointment when informed by the
  waiter at the inn, that no inquiries had yet been made after me, on
  the part of writers desirous of professional assistance. Strachan had
  been wiser. Somehow or other, he had gotten a letter of introduction
  to one Bailie Beerie, a notable civic dignitary of the place; and
  accordingly, on presenting his credentials, was invited by that
  functionary to dinner, with a hint that he &quot;might maybe see a
  wheen real leddies in the evening.&quot; This pointed so plainly to a
  white choker and dress boots, that Strachan durst not take the
  liberty of volunteering the attendance of his friend; and accordingly
  I had been left alone to wile away, as I best might, the tedium of a
  sluggish evening. Before starting, however, Tom pledged himself to
  return in time for supper; as he entertained a painful conviction
  that the party would be excessively slow.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg
  215]</a></span> So long as it was light, I amused myself pretty well,
  by strolling along the banks of the river, and enunciating a splendid
  speech for the pannel in an imaginary case of murder. However, before
  I reached the peroration, (which was to consist of a vivid picture of
  the deathbed of a despairing jury-man, conscience-stricken by the
  recollection of an erroneous verdict,) the shades of evening began to
  close in; the trouts ceased to leap in the pool, and the rooks
  desisted from their cawing. I returned to discuss my solitary mutton
  at the inn; and then, having nothing to do, sat down to a moderate
  libation, and an odd number of the Temperance Magazine, which
  valuable tract had been left for the reformation of the traveller by
  some peripatetic disciple of Father Mathew.</p>

  <p>Nine o&#39;clock came, but so did not Strachan. I began to wax
  wroth, muttered anathemas against my faithless friend, rang for the
  waiter, and&#8212;having ascertained the fact that a Masonic Lodge
  was that evening engaged in celebrating the festival of its peculiar
  patron&#8212;I set out for the purpose of assisting in the pious and
  mystic labours of the Brethren of the Jedburgh St Jeremy. At twelve,
  when I returned to my quarters, escorted by the junior deacon, I was
  informed that Strachan had not made his appearance, and accordingly I
  went to bed.</p>

  <p>Next morning, I found Tom, as already mentioned, in his couch.
  There was a fine air of negligence in the manner in which his
  habiliments were scattered over the room. One glazed boot lay within
  the fender, whilst the other had been chucked into a coal-scuttle;
  and there were evident marks of mud on the surface of his glossy
  kerseymeres. Strachan himself looked excessively pale, and the sole
  rejoinder he made to my preliminary remark was, a request for
  soda-water.</p>

  <p>&quot;Tom,&quot; said I, inexpressibly shocked at the implied
  confession of the nature of his vespers&#8212;&quot;I wonder you are
  not ashamed of yourself! Have you no higher regard for the dignity of
  the bar you represent, than to expose yourself before a Jedburgh
  Bailie?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Dignity be hanged!&quot; replied the incorrigible Strachan.
  &quot;Bailie Beerie is a brick, and I won&#39;t hear a word against
  him. But, O Fred! if you only knew what you missed last night! Such a
  splendid woman&#8212;by Jove, sir, a thoroughbred angel. A bust like
  one of Titian&#39;s beauties, and the voice of a lovelorn
  nightingale!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;One of the Misses Beerie, I presume. Come, Tom, I think I
  can fill up your portrait. Hair of the auburn complexion, slightly
  running into the carrot&#8212;skin fair, but freckled&#8212;greenish
  eyes&#8212;red elbows&#8212;culpable ankles&#8212;elephantine
  waist&#8212;and sentiments savouring of the Secession.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Ring the bell for the waiter, and hold your impious tongue.
  You never were farther from the mark in your life. The wing of the
  raven is not more glossy than her hair&#8212;and oh, the depth and
  melting lustre of those dark unfathomable eyes! Waiter! a bottle of
  soda-water, and you may put in a thimbleful of cognac.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Come, Tom!&#8212;none of your ravings. Is this an actual
  Armida, or a new freak of your own imagination?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;<i>BonÃ¢ fide</i>&#8212;an angel in every thing, barring the
  wings.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Then how the deuce did such a phenomenon happen to emerge at
  the Bailie&#39;s?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;That&#39;s the very question I was asking myself during the
  whole time of dinner. She was clearly not a Scotswoman. When she
  spoke, it was in the sweet low accents of a southern clime, and she
  waved away the proffered haggis with an air of the prettiest
  disgust!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;But the Bailie knew her?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Of course he did. I got the whole story out of him after
  dinner, and, upon my honour, I think it is the most romantic one I
  have ever heard. About a week ago, the lady arrived here without
  attendants. Some say she came in the mail-coach&#8212;others in a
  dark travelling chariot and pair. However, what matters it? the jewel
  can derive no lustre or value from the casket!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes&#8212;but one always likes to have some kind of idea of
  the setting. Get on.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;She seemed in great distress, and inquired whether there
  were any <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg
  216]</a></span>letters at the post-office addressed to the Honourable
  Dorothea Percy. No such epistle was to be found. She then
  interrogated the landlord, whether an elderly lady, whose appearance
  she minutely described, had been seen in the neighbourhood of
  Jedburgh; but except old Mrs Slammingham of Summertrees, who has been
  bed-ridden for years, there was nobody in the county who at all
  answered to the description. On hearing this, the lady seemed
  profoundly agitated&#8212;shut herself up in a private parlour, and
  refused all sustenance.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Had she not a reticule with sandwiches, Tom?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Do not tempt me to commit justifiable homicide&#8212;you see
  I am in the act of shaving.&#8212;At last the landlady, who is a most
  respectable person, and who felt deeply interested at the desolate
  situation of the poor young lady, ventured to solicit an interview.
  She was admitted. There are moments when the sympathy of even the
  humblest friend is precious. Miss Percy felt grateful for the
  interest so displayed, and confided the tale of her griefs to the
  matronly bosom of the hostess.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;And she told you?</p>

  <p>&quot;No,&#8212;but she told Bailie Beerie. That active magistrate
  thought it his duty to interfere. He waited upon Miss Percy, and from
  her lips he gathered the full particulars of her history. Percy is
  not her real name, but she is the daughter of an English peer of very
  ancient family. Her father having married a second time, Dorothea was
  exposed to the persecutions of a low-minded vulgar woman, whose whole
  ideas were of that mean and mercenary description which characterise
  the Caucasian race. Naomi Shekles was the offspring of a Jew, and she
  hated, whilst she envied, the superior charms of the noble Norman
  maiden. But she had gained an enormous supremacy over the wavering
  intellect of the elderly Viscount; and Dorothea was commanded to
  receive, with submission, the addressses of a loathsome apostate, who
  had made a prodigious fortune in the railways.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;One of the tribe of Issachar?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Exactly. A miscreant whose natural function was the vending
  of cast habiliments. Conceive, Fred, what the fair young creature
  must have felt at the bare idea of such shocking spousals! She
  besought, prayed, implored,&#8212;but all in vain. Mammon had taken
  too deep a root in the paternal heart,&#8212;the old coronet had been
  furbished up by means of Israelitish gold, and the father could not
  see any degradation in forcing upon his child an alliance similar to
  his own.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;You interest me excessively.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Is it not a strange tale?&quot; continued Thomas, adjusting
  a false collar round his neck. &quot;I knew you would agree with me
  when I came to the pathetic part. Well, Fred, the altar was decked,
  the ornaments ready, the Rabbi bespoke&#8212;&#8212;&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Do you mean to say, Strachan, that Lady Dorothea was to have
  been married after the fashion of the Jews?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I don&#39;t know exactly. I think Beerie said it was a
  Rabbi; but that may have been a flight of his own imagination.
  However, somebody was ready to have tied the nuptial knot, and all
  the joys of existence, and its hopes, were about to fade for ever
  from the vision of my poor Dorothea!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;<i>Your</i> Dorothea!&quot; cried I in amazement. &quot;Why,
  Tom&#8212;you don&#39;t mean to insinuate that you have gone that
  length already?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Did I say mine?&quot; repeated Strachan, looking somewhat
  embarrassed. &quot;It was a mere figure of speech: you always take
  one up so uncommonly short.&#8212;Nothing remained for her but
  flight, or submission to the Cruel mandate. Like a heroic girl, in
  whose veins the blood of the old crusaders was bounding, she
  preferred the former alternative. The only relation whom she could
  apply in so delicate, a juncture, was an aged aunt, residing
  somewhere in the north of Scotland. To her she wrote, beseeching her,
  as she regarded the memory of her buried sister, to receive her
  miserable child; and she appointed this town, Jedburgh, as the place
  of meeting.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;But where&#39;s the aunt?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;That&#39;s just the mysterious part of the business. The
  crisis was so imminent that Dorothea could not wait for a reply. She
  disguised her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id=
  "Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>self,&#8212;packed up a few jewels
  which had been bequeathed to her by her mother,&#8212;and, at the
  dead of night, escaped from her father&#39;s mansion. Judge of her
  terror when, on arriving here, panting and perhaps pursued, she could
  obtain no trace whatever of her venerable relative. Alone,
  inexperienced and unfriended, I tremble to think what might have been
  her fate, had it not been for the kind humanity of Beerie.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;And what was the Bailie&#39;s line of conduct?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;He behaved to her, Fred, like a parent. He supplied her
  wants, and invited her to make his house her home, at least until the
  aunt should appear. But the noble creature would not subject herself
  to the weight of so many obligations. She accepted, indeed, his
  assistance, but preferred remaining here, until she could place
  herself beneath legitimate guardianship. And doubtless,&quot;
  continued Strachan with fervour, &quot;her good angel is watching
  over her.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;And this is the whole story?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;The whole.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Do you know, Tom, it looks uncommonly like a piece of
  deliberate humbug!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Your ignorance misleads you, Fred. You would not say so had
  you seen her. So sweet&#8212;so gentle&#8212;with such a tinge of
  melancholy resignation in her eye, like that of a virgin martyr about
  to suffer at the stake! No one could look upon her for a moment, and
  doubt her purity and truth.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Perhaps. But you must allow that we are not living exactly
  in the ages of romance. An elopement with an officer of dragoons is
  about the farthest extent of legitimate enterprise which is left to a
  modern damsel; and, upon my word, I think the story would have told
  better, had some such hero been inserted as a sort of counterpoise to
  the Jew. But what&#39;s the matter? Have you lost any
  thing?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;It is very odd!&quot; said Strachan, &quot;I am perfectly
  certain that I had on my emerald studs last night. I recollect that
  Dorothea admired them exceedingly. Where on earth can I have put
  them?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m sure. I suspect, Tom, you and the
  Bailie were rather convivial after supper. Is your watch wound
  up?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Of course it is. I assure you you are quite wrong. It was a
  mere matter of four or five tumblers. Very odd this! Why&#8212;I
  can&#39;t find my watch neither!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Hallo! what the deuce! Have we fallen into a den of thieves?
  This is a nice beginning to our circuit practice.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I could swear, Fred, that I put it below my pillow before I
  went to sleep. I remember, now, that it was some time before I could
  fit in the key. What can have become of it?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;And you have not left your room since?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;No, on my word of honour!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Pooh&#8212;pooh! Then it can&#39;t possibly be gone. Look
  beneath the bolster.&quot;</p>

  <p>But in vain did we search beneath bolster, mattress, and blankets;
  yea, even downwards to the fundamental straw. Not a trace was to be
  seen of Cox Savory&#39;s horizontal lever, jewelled, as Tom
  pathetically remarked, in four special holes, and warranted to go for
  a year without more than a minute&#39;s deviation. Neither were the
  emerald studs, the pride of Strachan&#39;s heart, forthcoming. Boots,
  chamber-maid, and waiter were collectively summoned&#8212;all
  assisted in the search, and all asseverated their own integrity.</p>

  <p>&quot;Are ye sure, sir, that ye brocht them hame?&quot; said the
  waiter, an acute lad, who had served his apprenticeship at a
  commercial tavern in the Gorbals; &quot;Ye was gey an&#39; fou when
  ye cam in here yestreen.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;What do you mean, you rascal?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Ye ken ye wadna gang to bed till ye had anither
  tumbler.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Don&#39;t talk trash! It was the weakest cold-without in the
  creation.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;And then ye had a sair fecht on politics wi&#39; anither man
  in the coffee-room.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Ha! I remember now&#8212;the bagman, who is a member of the
  League! Where is the commercial villain?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;He gaed aff at sax preceesely, this morning, in his gig, to
  Kelso.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Then, by the head of Thistlewood!&quot; cried Strachan,
  frantically, &quot;my ticker will be turned into tracts against the
  corn-laws!&quot;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id=
  "Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

  <p>&quot;Hoot na!&quot; said the waiter, &quot;I canna think that. He
  looked an unco respectable-like man.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;No man can be respectable,&quot; replied the aristocratic
  Thomas, &quot;who sports such infernal opinions as I heard him utter
  last night. My poor studs! Fred.&#8212;they were a gift from Mary
  Rivers before we quarreled, and I would not have lost them for the
  universe! Only think of them being exposed for sale at a free-trade
  bazar!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Come, Tom&#8212;they may turn up yet.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Never in this world, except at a pawnbroker&#39;s. I could
  go mad to think that my last memorial of Mary is in all probability
  glittering in the unclean shirt of a bagman!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Had you not better apply to the Fiscal?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;For what purpose? Doubtless the scoundrel has driven off to
  the nearest railway, and is triumphantly counting the mile-posts as
  he steams to his native Leeds. No, Fred. Both watch and studs are
  gone beyond the hope of redemption.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;The loss is certainly a serious one.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;No doubt of it: but a thought strikes me. You recollect the
  edict, <i>nautÃ¦</i>, <i>caupones</i>, <i>stabularii</i>? I have not
  studied the civil law for nothing and am clearly of opinion, that in
  such a case the landlord is liable.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;By Jove! I believe you are right. But it would be as well to
  turn up Shaw and Dunlop for a precedent before you make any row about
  it. Besides, it may be rather difficult to establish that you lost
  them at the inn.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;If they only refer the matter to my oath, I can easily
  settle that point,&quot; replied Strachan. &quot;Besides, now that I
  think of it, Miss Percy can speak to the watch. She asked me what
  o&#39;clock it was just before we parted on the stairs.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Eh, what! Is the lady in this house?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;To be sure&#8212;did I not tell you so?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I say, Tom&#8212;couldn&#39;t you contrive to let one have a
  peep at this angel of yours?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Quite impossible. She is the shyest creature in the world,
  and would shrink from the sight of a stranger.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;But, my dear Tom&#8212;&#8212;&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I can&#39;t do it, I tell you; so it&#39;s no use asking
  me.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Well, I must say you are abominably selfish. But what on
  earth are you going to do with that red and blue Joinville? You
  can&#39;t go down to court without a white neckcloth.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I am not going down to court.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Why, my good fellow! what on earth is the meaning of
  this?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I am not going down to court, that&#39;s all. I say, Fred,
  how do I look in this sort of thing?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Uncommonly like a cock-pheasant in full plumage. But tell me
  what you mean?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Why, since you must needs know, I am going up stairs to
  breakfast with Miss Percy.&quot;</p>

  <p>So saying, Mr Strachan made me a polite bow, and left the
  apartment. I took my solitary way to the courthouse, marvelling at
  the extreme rapidity of the effect which is produced by the envenomed
  darts of Cupid.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

  <p>On entering the court, I found that the business had commenced. An
  enormous raw-boned fellow, with a shock of the fieriest hair, and
  hands of such dimensions that a mere glimpse of them excited
  unpleasant sensations at your windpipe, was stationed at the bar, to
  which, from previous practice, he had acquired a sort of prescriptive
  right.</p>

  <p>&quot;James M&#39;Wilkin, or Wilkinson, or Wilson,&quot; said the
  presiding judge, in a tone of disgust which heightened with each
  successive alias, &quot;attend to the indictment which is about to be
  preferred against you.&quot;</p>

  <p>And certainly, if the indictment contained a true statement of the
  facts, James M&#39;Wilkin, or Wilkinson, or Wilson was about as
  thoroughpaced a marauder as ever perambulated a common. He was
  charged with sheep-stealing and assault; inasmuch as, on a certain
  night subsequent to the Kelso fair, he, the said individual with the
  plural denominations, did wickedly <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>and feloniously steal,
  uplift, and away take from a field adjoining to the Northumberland
  road, six wethers, the property, or in the lawful possession of,
  Jacob Gubbins, grazier, then and now or lately residing in Morpeth;
  and moreover, on being followed by the said Gubbins, who demanded
  restitution of his property, he, the said M&#39;Wilkin, &amp;c., had,
  in the most brutal manner, struck, knocked down, and lavished divers
  kicks upon the corporality of the Northumbrian bumpkin, to the
  fracture of three of his ribs, and otherwise, to the injury of his
  person.</p>

  <p>During the perusal of this formidable document by the clerk,
  M&#39;Wilkin stood scratching his poll, and leering about him as
  though he considered the whole ceremony as a sort of solemn joke. I
  never in the course of my life cast eyes on a more nonchalant or
  unmitigated ruffian.</p>

  <p>&quot;How do you say, M&#39;Wilkin,&quot; asked the judge;
  &quot;are you guilty or not guilty?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Not guilty, aff course. D&#39;ye tak me for a fule?&quot;
  and M&#39;Wilkin flounced down upon his seat, as though he had been
  an ornament to society.</p>

  <p>&quot;Have you a counsel?&quot; asked the judge.</p>

  <p>&quot;De&#39;il ane&#8212;nor a bawbee,&quot; replied the
  freebooter.</p>

  <p>Acting upon the noble principle of Scottish jurisprudence, that no
  man shall undergo his trial without sufficient legal advice, his
  lordship in the kindest manner asked me to take charge of the
  fortunes of the forlorn M&#39;Wilkin. Of course I made no scruples;
  for, so long as it was matter of practice, I should have felt no
  hesitation in undertaking the defence of Beelzebub. I therefore
  leaned across the dock, and exchanged a few hurried sentences with my
  first client.</p>

  <p>&quot;Why don&#39;t you plead guilty?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;What for? I&#39;ve been here before. Man, I&#39;m thinking
  ye&#39;re a saft ane!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Did you not steal the sheep.&quot;&#39;</p>

  <p>&quot;Ay&#8212;that&#39;s just the question. Let them find that
  out.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;But the grazier saw you?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I blackened his e&#39;es.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;You&#39;ll be transported to a dead certainty.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Deevil a fears, if ye&#39;re worth the price o&#39; half a
  mutchkin. I&#39;m saying&#8212;get me a Hawick jury, and it&#39;s
  a&#39; richt. They ken me gey and weel thereabouts.&quot;</p>

  <p>Although I was by no means satisfied in my own mind that an
  intimate acquaintance with M&#39;Wilkin and his previous pursuits
  would be a strong recommendation in his favour to any possible
  assize, I thought it best to follow his instructions, and managed my
  challenges so well that I secured a majority of Hawickers. The jury
  being sworn in, the cause proceeded; and certainly, before three
  witnesses had been examined, it appeared to me beyond all manner of
  doubt, that, in the language of Tom Campbell, my unfortunate client
  was</p>

  <div>
    <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">&quot;Doom&#39;d the long coves
    of Sydney isle to see,&quot;</span><br />
  </div>

  <p>as a permanent addition to that cultivated and Patagonian
  population. The grazier stood to his story like a man, and all
  efforts to break him down by cross-examination were fruitless. There
  was also another hawbuck who swore to the sheep, and was witness to
  the assault; so that, in fact, the evidence was legally complete.</p>

  <p>Whilst I was occupied in the vain attempt to make Gubbins
  contradict himself, there had been a slight commotion in the
  court-room. On looking round afterwards, I was astonished to behold
  my friend Strachan seated in the magistrate&#39;s box, next to a very
  pretty and showily-dressed woman, to whom he was paying the most
  marked and deliberate attention. On the other side of her was an
  individual in a civic chain, whose fat, pursy, apoplectic appearance,
  and nose of the colour of an Orleans plum, thoroughly realised my
  mental picture of the Bailie. His small, blood-shot eyes twinkled
  with magisterial dignity and importance; and he looked, beside Miss
  Percy&#8212;for I could not doubt that it was she&#8212;like a satyr
  in charge of Florimel.</p>

  <p>The last witness for the crown, a very noted police officer from
  Glasgow, was then put into the box, to prove a previous conviction
  against my friend M&#39;Wilkin. This man bore a high reputation in
  his calling, and was, indeed, esteemed as a sort of Scottish Vidocq,
  who knew by headmark every filcher of a handkerchief between
  Caithness and the Border. He met <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>the bold broad stare of
  the prisoner with a kind of nod, as much as to assure him that his
  time was very nearly up; and then deliberately proceeded to take a
  hawk&#39;s-eye view of the assembly. I noticed a sort of quiet sneer
  as he glanced at the Magistrate&#39;s box.</p>

  <p>&quot;Poor Strachan!&quot; thought I. &quot;His infatuation must
  indeed be palpable, since even a common officer can read his secret
  in a moment.&quot;</p>

  <p>I might just as well have tried to shake Ailsa Craig as to make an
  impression upon this witness; however, heroically devoted to my
  trust, I hazarded the attempt, and ended by bringing out several
  additional tales of turpitude in the life and times of
  M&#39;Wilkin.</p>

  <p>&quot;Make room there in the passage! The lady has fainted,&quot;
  cried the macer.</p>

  <p>I started to my feet, and was just in time to see Miss Percy
  conveyed from the court in an apparently inanimate state, by the
  Bailie and the agitated Strachan.</p>

  <p>&quot;Devilish fine-looking woman that!&quot; observed the
  Advocate-Depute across the table. &quot;Where did your friend Mr
  Strachan get hold of her?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I really don&#39;t know. I say&#8212;are you going to
  address the jury for the crown?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;It is quite immaterial. The case is distinctly proved, and I
  presume you don&#39;t intend to speak?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I&#39;m not so sure of that.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh, well,&#8212;in that case I suppose I must say a word or
  two. This closes the evidence for the crown, my lord,&quot; and the
  Depute began to turn over his papers preparatory to a short
  harangue.</p>

  <p>He had just commenced his speech, when I felt a hand laid upon my
  shoulder. I looked around: Strachan was behind me, pale and almost
  breathless with excitement.</p>

  <p>&quot;Fred&#8212;can I depend upon your friendship?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Of course you can. What&#39;s the row?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Have you ten pounds about you?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes&#8212;but what do you mean to do with them? Surely you
  are not going to make a blockhead of yourself by bolting?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;No&#8212;no! give me the money&#8212;quick!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;On your word of honour, Tom?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;On my sacred word of honour!&#8212;That&#39;s a good
  fellow&#8212;thank you, Fred;&quot; and Strachen pocketed the
  currency. &quot;Now,&quot; said he, &quot;I have just one other
  request to make.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Speak against time, there&#39;s a dear fellow! Spin out the
  case as long as you can, and don&#39;t let the jury retire for at
  least three quarters of an hour. I know you can do it better than any
  other man at the bar.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Are you in earnest, Tom?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Most solemnly. My whole future happiness&#8212;nay, perhaps
  the life of a human being depends upon it.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;In that case I think I shall tip them an hour.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Heaven reward you, Fred! I never can forget your
  kindness!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;But where shall I see you afterwards?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;At the hotel. Now, my dear boy, be sure that you pitch it
  in, and, if possible, get the judge to charge after you. Time&#39;s
  all that&#39;s wanted&#8212;adieu!&quot; and Tom disappeared in a
  twinkling.</p>

  <p>I had little leisure to turn over the meaning of this interview in
  my mind, for the address of my learned opponent was very short and
  pithy. He merely pointed out the clear facts, as substantiated by
  evidence, and brought home to the unhappy M&#39;Wilkin; and concluded
  by demanding a verdict on both charges contained in the indictment
  against the prisoner.</p>

  <p>&quot;Do you wish to say any thing, sir?&quot; said the judge to
  me, with a kind of tone which indicated his hope that I was going to
  say nothing. Doubtless his lordship thought that, as a very young
  counsel, I would take the hint; but he was considerably mistaken in
  his man. I came to the bar for practice&#8212;I went on the circuit
  with the solemn determination to speak in every case, however
  desperate; and it needed not the admonition of Strachan to make me
  carry my purpose into execution. What did I care about occupying the
  time of the court? His lordship was paid to listen, and could very
  well afford to hear the man who was pleading for M&#39;Wilkin without
  a fee. I must say, however, that he looked somewhat disgusted when I
  rose.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg
  221]</a></span></p>

  <p>A first appearance is a nervous thing, but there is nothing like
  going boldly at your subject. &quot;<i>Fiat experimentum in corpore
  vili</i>,&quot; is a capital maxim in the Justiciary Court. The worse
  your case, the less chance you have to spoil it; and I never had a
  worse than M&#39;Wilkin&#39;s.</p>

  <p>I began by buttering the jury on their evident intelligence and
  the high functions they had to discharge, which of course were
  magnified to the skies. I then went slap-dash at the evidence; and,
  as I could say nothing in favour of my client, directed a tremendous
  battery of abuse and insinuation against his accuser.</p>

  <p>&quot;And who is this Gubbins, gentlemen, that you should believe
  this most incredible, most atrocious, and most clumsy apocrypha of
  his? I will tell you. He is an English butcher&#8212;a dealer in
  cattle and in bestial&#8212;one of those men who derive their whole
  subsistence from the profits realised by the sale of our native
  Scottish produce. This is the way in which our hills are depopulated,
  and our glens converted into solitudes. It is for him and his
  confederates&#8212;not for us&#8212;that our shepherds watch and
  toil, that our herds and flocks are reared, that the richness of the
  land is absorbed! And who speaks to the character of this Gubbins?
  You have heard the pointless remarks made by my learned friend upon
  the character of my unfortunate client; but he has not dared to
  adduce in this court one single witness in behalf of the character of
  his witness. Gentlemen, he durst not do it! Gubbins has deponed to
  you that he bought those sheep at the fair of Kelso, from a person of
  the name of Shiells, and that he paid the money for them. Where is
  the evidence of that? Where is Shiells to tell us whether he actually
  sold these sheep, or whether on the contrary they were not stolen
  from him? Has it been proved to you, gentlemen, that M&#39;Wilkin is
  not a friend of Shiells&#8212;that he did not receive notice of the
  theft&#8212;that he did not pursue the robber, and, recognising the
  stolen property by their mark, seize them for the benefit of their
  owner? No such proof at least has been led upon the part of the
  crown, and in the absence of it, I ask you fearlessly, whether you
  can possibly violate your consciences by returning a verdict of
  guilty? Is it not possible&#8212;nay, is it not extremely probable,
  that Gubbins was the actual thief? Was it not his interest, far more
  than M&#39;Wilkin&#39;s, to abstract those poor unhappy sheep,
  because it is avowedly his trade to fill the insatiable maw of the
  Southron? And in that case, who should be at the bar? Gubbins!
  Gubbins, I say, who this day has the unparalleled audacity to appear
  before an enlightened Scottish jury, and to give evidence which, in
  former times, might have led to the awful consequence of the
  execution of an innocent man! And this is what my learned friend
  calls evidence! Evidence to condemn a fellow-countryman, gentlemen?
  No&#8212;not to condemn a dog!&quot;</p>

  <p>Having thus summarily disposed of Gubbins, I turned my artillery
  against the attendant drover and the policeman. The first I
  indignantly denounced as either an accomplice or a tool: the second I
  smote more severely. Policemen are not popular in Hawick; and,
  knowing this, I contrived to blacken the Scottish Vidocq as a
  bloodhound.</p>

  <p>But by far the finest flight of fancy in which I indulged was
  reserved for the peroration. I was not quite sure of the effect of my
  commentary on the evidence, and therefore thought it might be
  advisable to touch upon a national raw.</p>

  <p>&quot;And now, gentlemen,&quot; said I, &quot;assuming for one
  moment that all my learned friend has said to you is true&#8212;that
  the sheep really belonged to this Gubbins, and were taken from him by
  M&#39;Wilkin&#8212;let us calmly and deliberately consider how far
  such a proceeding can be construed into a crime. What has my
  unfortunate client done that he should be condemned by a jury of his
  countrymen? What he stands charged with is simply this&#8212;that he
  has prevented an Englishman from driving away the produce of our
  native hills. And is this a crime? It may be so, for aught I know, by
  statute; but sure I am, that in the intention, to which alone you
  must look, there lies a far deeper element of patriotism than of
  deliberate guilt. Think for <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222"
  id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>one moment, gentlemen, of the annals
  of which we are so proud&#8212;of the ballads still chanted in the
  hall and in the hamlet&#8212;of the lonely graves and headstones that
  are scattered all along the surface of the southern muirs. Do not
  these annals tell us how the princes and the nobles of the land were
  wont to think it neither crime nor degradation to march with their
  retainers across the Borders, and to harry with fire and sword the
  fields of Northumberland and Durham? Randolph and the Bruce have done
  it, and yet no one dares to attach the stigma of dishonour to their
  names. Do not our ballads tell how at Lammas-tide,</p>

  <div>
    <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">&#39;The doughty Earl of Douglas
    rade</span><br />
    <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Into England to fetch a
    prey?&#39;</span><br />
  </div>

  <p>And who shall venture to impeach the honour of the hero who fell
  upon the field of Otterbourne? Need I remind you of those who have
  died in their country&#39;s cause, and whose graves are still made
  the object of many a pious pilgrimage? Need I speak of Flodden, that
  woful place where the Flowers of the Forest were left lying in one
  ghastly heap around their king? Ah, gentlemen! have I touched you
  now? True, it was in the Olden time that these things were done and
  celebrated; but remember this, that society may change its place,
  states and empires may rise and be consolidated, but patriotism still
  lives enduring and undying as of yore! And who shall dare to say that
  patriotism was not the motive of M&#39;Wilkin? Who shall presume to
  analyse or to blame the instinct which may have driven him to the
  deed? Call him not a felon&#8212;call him rather a poet; for over his
  kindling imagination fell the mighty shadow of the past. Old
  thoughts, old feelings, old impulses, were burning in his soul. He
  saw in Gubbins, not the grazier, but the lawless spoiler of his
  country; and he rose, as a Borderer should, to vindicate the honour
  of his race. He may have been mistaken in what he did, but the
  motive, at least, was pure. Honour it then, gentlemen, for it is the
  same motive which is at all times the best safeguard of a
  nation&#39;s independence; and do honour likewise to yourselves by
  pronouncing a unanimous verdict of acquittal in favour of the
  prisoner at the bar!&quot;</p>

  <p>By the time I had finished this harangue, I was wrought up to such
  a pitch of enthusiasm, that I really considered M&#39;Wilkin in the
  light of an extremely ill-used individual, and the tears stood in my
  eyes as I recapitulated the history of his wrongs. Several of the
  jury, too, began to get extremely excited, and looked as fierce as
  falcons when I reminded them of the field of Flodden. But my hopes
  were considerably damped when I heard the charge of his lordship.
  With all respect for the eminent Senator who that day presided on the
  bench, I think he went rather too far when he designated my
  maiden-effort a rhapsody which could only be excused on account of
  the inexperience of the gentleman who uttered it. Passing from that
  unpleasant style of stricture, he went <i>seriatim</i> over all the
  crimes of M&#39;Wilkin, and very distinctly indicated his opinion
  that a more consummate ruffian had seldom figured in the dock. When
  he concluded, however, there was a good deal of whispering in the
  jury-box, and at last the gentlemen of the assize requested
  permission to retire.</p>

  <p>&quot;That was a fine flare-up of yours, Freddy,&quot; said
  Anthony Whaup, the only other counsel for the prisoners upon the
  circuit. &quot;You came it rather strong, though, in the national
  line. I don&#39;t think our venerable friend overhead half likes your
  ideas of international law.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Why, yes&#8212;I confess he gave me a tolerable wigging. But
  what would you have me do? I must have said something.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh, by Jove, you were perfectly right! I always make a point
  of speaking myself; and I can assure you that you did remarkably
  well. It was a novel view, but decidedly ingenious, and may lead to
  great results. If that fellow gets off, you may rely upon it there
  will be some bloodshed again upon the Border.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;And a jolly calendar, of course, for next circuit. I say,
  Authony,&#8212;how many cases have you got?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Two thefts with habit and repute, a hame-sucken, rather a
  good forgery, and an assault with intent to commit.&quot;<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

  <p>&quot;Long?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Rather&#8212;but poor pay. I haven&#39;t sacked more than
  nine guineas altogether. Gad!&quot; continued Anthony, stretching
  himself, &quot;this is slow work. I&#39;d rather by a great deal be
  rowing on the canal.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Hush! here come the jury.&quot;</p>

  <p>They entered, took their seats, and each man in succession
  answered to his name. I stole a glance at M&#39;Wilkin. He looked as
  leonine as ever, and kept winking perseveringly to the Hawickers.</p>

  <p>&quot;Now, gentlemen,&quot; said the clerk of court, &quot;what is
  your verdict?&quot;</p>

  <p>The foreman rose.</p>

  <p>&quot;The jury, by a majority, find the charges against the
  prisoner <span class='smcap'>not proven</span>.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Hurrah!&quot; shouted M&#39;Wilkin, reckless of all
  authority. &quot;Hurrah! I say&#8212;you counsellor in the
  wig&#8212;ye shanna want a sheep&#39;s head thae three years, if
  there&#39;s ane to be had on the Border!&quot;</p>

  <p>And in this way I gained my first acquittal.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

  <p>I found Strachan in his room with his face buried in the
  bed-clothes. He was kicking his legs as though he suffered under a
  violent fit of the toothache.</p>

  <p>&quot;I say, Tom, what&#39;s the matter? Look up, man! Do you know
  I&#39;ve got that scoundrel off?&quot;</p>

  <p>No answer.</p>

  <p>&quot;Tom, I say! Tom, you dunderhead&#8212;what do you mean by
  making an ass of yourself this way? Get up, for shame, and answer
  me!&quot;</p>

  <p>Poor Strachan raised his head from the coverlet. His eyes were
  absolutely pink, and his cheeks of the tint of a lemon.</p>

  <p>&quot;O Fred, Fred!&quot; said he with a series of interjectional
  gasps. &quot;I am the most unfortunate wretch in the universe. All
  the hopes I had formerly cherished are blighted at once in the bud!
  She is gone, my friend&#8212;gone away from me, and, alas! I fear for
  ever!</p>

  <p>&quot;The deuce she has! and how?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh what madness tempted me to lead her to the
  court?&#8212;what infatuation it was to expose those angelic features
  to the risk of recognition! Who that ever saw those dove-like eyes
  could forget them?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I have no objection to the eyes&#8212;they were really very
  passable. But who twigged her?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;An emissary of her father&#39;s&#8212;that odious miscreant
  who was giving evidence at the trial.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;The policeman? Whew! Tom!&#8212;I don&#39;t like
  that.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;He was formerly the land-steward of the Viscount;&#8212;a
  callous, cruel wretch, who was more than suspected of having made
  away with his wife.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;And did he recognise her?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Dorothea says that she felt fascinated by the glitter of his
  cold gray eye. A shuddering sensation passed through her frame, just
  as the poor warbler of the woods quivers at the approach of the
  rattle-snake. A dark mist gathered before her sight, and she saw no
  more until she awoke to consciousness within my arms.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Very pretty work, truly! And what then?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;In great agitation, she told me that she durst tarry no
  longer here. She was certain that the officer would make it his
  business to track her, and communicate her hiding-place to her
  family; and she shook with horror when she thought of the odious
  Israelitish bridegroom. &#39;The caverns of the deep green
  sea&#8212;the high Tarpeian rock&#8212;the Lencadian cliff of
  Sappho,&#39;&#8212;she said, &#39;all would be preferable to that!
  And yet, O Thomas, to think that we should have met so suddenly, and
  that to part for ever!&#39; &#39;Pon my soul, Fred, I am the most
  miserable of created beings.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Why, what on earth has become of her?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Gone&#8212;and I don&#39;t know whither. She would not even
  apprise the Bailie of her departure, lest she might leave some clue
  for discovery. She desired me to see him, to thank him, and to pay
  him for her,&#8212;all of which I promised to do. With one
  kiss&#8212;one deep, burning, agonised kiss, which I shall carry with
  me to my grave&#8212;- she tore herself away, sprang into the
  postchaise, and in <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id=
  "Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>another moment was lost to me for
  ever!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;And my ten pounds?&quot; said I, in a tone of considerable
  emotion.</p>

  <p>&quot;Would you have had me think twice,&quot; asked Strachan
  indignantly, &quot;before I tendered my assistance to a forlorn angel
  in distress, even though she possessed no deeper claims on my
  sympathy? I thought, Frederick, you had more chivalry in your nature.
  You need not be uneasy about that trifle;&#8212;I shall be in funds
  some time about Christmas.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Humph! I thought it was a P.P. transaction, but no matter.
  And is this all the clue you have got to the future residence of the
  lady?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;No,&#8212;she is to write me from the nearest post-town. You
  will see, Fred, when the letter arrives, how well worthy she is of my
  adoration.&quot;</p>

  <p>I have found, by long experience, that it is no use remonstrating
  with a man who is head-over-ears in love. The tender passion affects
  us differently, according to our constitutions. One set of fellows,
  who are generally the pleasantest, seldom get beyond the length of
  flirtation. They are always at it, but constantly changing, and
  therefore manage to get through a tolerable catalogue of attachments
  before they are finally brought to book. Such men are quite able to
  take care of themselves, and require but little admonition. You no
  doubt hear them now and then abused for trifling with the affections
  of young women&#8212;as if the latter had themselves the slightest
  remorse in playing precisely the same game!&#8212;but in most cases
  such censure is undeserved, for they are quite as much in earnest as
  their neighbours, so long as the impulse lasts. The true explanation
  is, that they have survived their first passion, and that their faith
  is somewhat shaken in the boyish creed of the absolute perfectibility
  of woman. The great disappointment of life does not make them
  misanthropes&#8212;but it forces them to caution, and to a closer
  appreciation of character than is usually undertaken in the first
  instance. They have become, perhaps, more selfish&#8212;certainly
  more suspicious, and though often on the verge of a proposal, they
  never commit themselves without an extreme degree of
  deliberation.</p>

  <p>Another set seem designed by nature to be the absolute victims of
  woman. Whenever they fall in love, they do it with an earnestness and
  an obstinacy which is actually appalling. The adored object of their
  affections can twine them round her finger, quarrel with them, cheat
  them, caricature them, or flirt with others, without the least risk
  of severing the triple cord of attachment. They become as tame as
  poodle-dogs, will submit patiently to any manner of cruelty or
  caprice, and in fact seem rather to be grateful for such treatment
  than otherwise. Clever women usually contrive to secure a captive of
  this kind. He is useful to them in a hundred ways, never interferes
  with their schemes, and, if the worst comes to the worst, they can
  always fall back upon him as a <i>pis-aller</i>.</p>

  <p>My friend Tom Strachan belonged decidedly to this latter section.
  Mary Rivers, a remarkably clever and very showy girl, but as arrant a
  flirt as ever wore rosebud in her bosom, had engrossed the whole of
  his heart before he reached the reflecting age of twenty, and kept
  him for nearly five years in a state of uncomplaining bondage. Not
  that I believe she ever cared about him. Tom was as poor as a
  church-mouse, and had nothing on earth to look to except the fruits
  of his professional industry, which, judging from all appearances,
  would be a long time indeed in ripening. Mary was not the sort of
  person to put up with love in a cottage, even had Tom&#39;s
  circumstances been adequate to defray the rent of a tenement of that
  description: she had a vivid appreciation not only of the
  substantials, but of the higher luxuries of existence. But her vanity
  was flattered at having in her train at least one devoted dangler,
  whom she could play off, whenever opportunity required, against some
  more valuable admirer. Besides, Strachan was a man of family, tall,
  good-looking, and unquestionably clever in his way: he also danced
  the polka well, and was useful in the ball-room or the pic-nic. So
  Mary Rivers kept him on in a kind of blissful dream, just sunning him
  sufficiently with her smiles to make him believe that he was beloved,
  but never allowing matters to go so far as <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>to lead
  to the report that they were engaged. Tom asked for nothing more. He
  was quite contented to indulge for years in a dream of future bliss,
  and wrote during the interval a great many more sonnets than
  summonses. Unfortunately sonnets don&#39;t pay well, so that his
  worldly affairs did not progress at any remarkable ratio. And he only
  awoke to a sense of his real situation, when Miss Rivers, having
  picked a quarrel with him one day in the Zoological Gardens,
  announced on the next to her friends that she had accepted the hand
  of a bilious East India merchant.</p>

  <p>Tom made an awful row about it&#8212;grew as attenuated and brown
  as an eel&#8212;and garnished his conversation with several
  significant hints about suicide. He was, however, saved from that
  ghastly alternative by being drafted into a Rowing Club, who plied
  their gondolas daily on the Union Canal. Hard exercise, beer, and
  pulling had their usual sanatory effect, and Tom gradually recovered
  his health, if not his spirits.</p>

  <p>It was at this very crisis that he fell in with this mysterious
  Miss Percy. There was an immense hole in his affections which
  required to be filled up; and, as nature abhors a vacuum, he plugged
  it with the image of Dorothea. The flight, therefore, of the fair
  levanter, after so brief an intercourse, was quite enough to upset
  him. He was in the situation of a man who is informed over-night that
  he has succeeded to a large fortune, and who gets a letter next
  morning explaining that it is a mere mistake. I was therefore not at
  all astonished either at his paroxysms or his credulity.</p>

  <p>We had rather a dreary dinner that day. The judges always
  entertain the first day of circuit, and it is considered matter of
  etiquette that the counsel should attend. Sometimes these forensic
  feeds are pleasant enough; but on the present occasion there was a
  visible damp thrown over the spirits of the party. His lordship was
  evidently savage at the unforeseen escape of M&#39;Wilkin, and looked
  upon me, as I thought, with somewhat of a prejudiced eye. Bailie
  Beeric and the other magistrates seemed uneasy at their unusual
  proximity to a personage who had the power of death and
  transportation, and therefore abstained from emitting the accustomed
  torrent of civic facetiousness. One of the sheriffs wanted to be off
  on a cruise, and another was unwell with the gout. The Depute
  Advocate was fagged; Whaup surly as a bear with a sore ear, on
  account of the tenuity of his fees; and Strachan, of course, in an
  extremely unconversational mood. So I had nothing for it but to eat
  and drink as plentifully as I could, and very thankful I was that the
  claret was tolerably sound.</p>

  <p>We rose from table early. As I did not like to leave Tom to
  himself in his present state of mind, we adjourned to his room for
  the purpose of enjoying a cigar; and there, sure enough, upon the
  table lay the expected missive. Strachan dashed at it like a pike
  pouncing upon a parr; I lay down upon the sofa, lit my weed, and
  amused myself by watching his physiognomy.</p>

  <p>&quot;Dear suffering angel!&quot; said Tom at last, with a sort of
  whimper, &quot;Destiny has done its worst! We have parted, and the
  first fond dream of our love has vanished before the cold and dreary
  dawn of reality! O my friend&#8212;we were like the two birds in the
  Oriental fable, each doomed to traverse the world before we could
  encounter our mate&#8212;we met, and almost in the same hour the
  thunderbolt burst above us!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Yes&#8212;two very nice birds,&quot; said I. &quot;But what
  does she say in the letter?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;You may read it,&quot; replied Tom, and he handed me the
  epistle. It was rather a superior specimen of penmanship, and I
  don&#39;t choose to criticise the style. Its tenor was as
  follows:&#8212;</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>&quot;I am hardly yet, my dear friend, capable of estimating the
    true extent of my emotions. Like the buoyant seaweed torn from its
    native bed among the submarine forest of the corals, I have been
    tossed from wave to wave, hurried onwards by a stream more
    resistless than that which sweeps through the Gulf of Labrador, and
    far&#8212;far away as yet is the wished-for haven of my rest.
    Hitherto my life has been a tissue of calamity and wo. Over my head
    since childhood, has stretched a dull and dreary canopy of clouds,
    shutting me out for ever from a glimpse of the blessed sun. Once,
    and but once <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id=
    "Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>only have I seen a chasm in that
    envious veil&#8212;only once and for a few, a <i>very</i> few
    moments, have I gazed upon the blue empyrean, and felt my heart
    expand and thrill to the glories of its liquid lustre. That
    once&#8212;oh, Mr Strachan, can I ever forget it?&#8212;that once
    comprises the era of the few hours which were the silent witnesses
    of our meeting!</p>

    <p>&quot;Am I weak in writing to you thus? Perhaps I am; but then,
    Thomas, I have never been taught to dissemble. Did I, however,
    think it probable that we should ever meet again&#8212;that I
    should hear from your lips a repetition of that language which now
    is chronicled in my soul&#8212;it may be that I would not have
    dared to risk an avowal so candid and so dear! As it is, it matters
    not. You have been my benefactor, my kind consoler&#8212;my friend.
    You have told me that you love; and in the fullness and native
    simplicity of my heart, I believe you. And if it be any
    satisfaction to you to know that your sentiments have been at least
    appreciated, believe that of all the pangs which the poor Dorothea
    has suffered, this last agony of parting has been incomparably the
    most severe.</p>

    <p>&quot;You asked me if there was no hope. Oh, my Thomas! what
    would I not give could I venture to answer, yes? But it cannot be!
    You are young and happy, and will yet be fortunate and beloved:
    why, then, should I permit so fair an existence to be blighted by
    the upas-tree of destiny under which I am doomed to languish? You
    shall not say that I am selfish&#8212;you shall not hereafter
    reproach me for having permitted you to share a burden too great
    for both of us to carry. You must learn the one great lesson of
    existence, to submit and to forget!</p>

    <p>&quot;I am going far away, to the margin of that inhospitable
    shore which receives upon its rocks the billows of the unbroken
    Atlantic,&#8212;or haply, amongst the remoter isles, I shall listen
    to the seamew&#39;s cry. Do not weep for me. Amidst the myriad of
    bright and glowing things which flutter over the surface of this
    green creation, let one feeble, choking, over-burdened heart be
    forgotten! Follow me not&#8212;seek me not&#8212;for, like the
    mermaid on the approach of the mariner, I should shrink from the
    face of man into the glassy caverns of the deep.</p>

    <p>&quot;Adieu, Thomas, adieu! Say what you will for me to the
    noble and generous Beerie. Would to heaven that I could send him
    some token in return for all his kindness, but a good and gallant
    heart is its own most adequate reward.</p>

    <p>&quot;They are putting to the horses&#8212;I can hear the rumble
    of the chariot! Oh, once more, dear friend&#8212;alas, too
    inexpressibly dear!&#8212;take my last farewell. Adieu&#8212;my
    heart is breaking as I write the bitter word!&#8212;forget me.</p>

    <div class="right">
      <span class='smcap'>Dorothea</span>.&quot;<br />
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>&quot;Do you wonder at my sorrow now?&quot; said Strachan, as I
  laid down the passionate epistle.</p>

  <p>&quot;Why, no. It is well got up upon the whole, and does credit
  to the lady&#39;s erudition. But I don&#39;t see why she should
  insist so strongly upon eternal separation. Have you no idea
  whereabouts that aunt of hers may happen to reside?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Not the slightest.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Because, judging from her letter, it must be somewhere about
  Benbecula or Tiree. I shouldn&#39;t even wonder if she had a summer
  box on St Kilda.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Right! I did not think of that&#8212;you observe she speaks
  of the remoter isles.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;To be sure, and for half a century there has not been a
  mermaid seen to the east of the Lewis. Now, take my advice,
  Tom&#8212;don&#39;t make a fool of yourself in the meantime, but wait
  until the Court of Session rises in July. That will allow plenty of
  time for matters to settle; and if the old Viscount and that
  abominable Abiram don&#39;t find her out before then, you may depend
  upon it they will abandon the search. In the interim, the lady will
  have cooled. Walks upon the sea-shore are uncommonly dull without
  something like reciprocal sentimentality. The odds are, that the old
  aunt is addicted to snuff, tracts, and the distribution of flannel,
  and before August, the fair Dorothea will be yearning for a sight of
  her adorer. You can easily gammon Anthony Whaup into a loan of that
  yacht of his which he makes such a boast of; and if you go prudently
  about it, and flatter him on the score of his steering, <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>I
  haven&#39;t the least doubt that he will victual his hooker and give
  you a cruise in it for nothing.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Admirable, my dear Fred! We shall touch at all the isles
  from Iona to Uist; and if Miss Percy be indeed there&#8212;&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;You can carry her off on five minutes&#39; notice, and our
  long friend will be abundantly delighted. Only, mind this! If you
  want my candid opinion on the wisdom of such an alliance, I should
  strongly recommend you to meddle no farther in the matter, for I have
  my doubts about the Honourable Dorothea, and&#8212;&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Bah, Fred! Doubts after such a letter as that? Impossible!
  No, my dear friend&#8212;your scheme is
  admirable&#8212;unexceptionable, and I shall certainly act upon it.
  But oh&#8212;it is a weary time till July!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Merely a short interval of green pease and strawberries. I
  advise you, however, to fix down Whaup as early as you can for the
  cruise.&quot;</p>

  <p>The hint was rapidly taken. We sent for our facetious friend,
  ordered supper, and in the course of a couple of tumblers, persuaded
  him that his knowledge of nautical affairs was not exceeded by that
  of T. P. Cooke, and that he was much deeper versed in the mysteries
  of sky-scraping than Fenimore Cooper. Whaup gave in. By dint of a
  little extra persuasion, I believe we might have coaxed him into a
  voyage for Otaheite; and before we parted for the evening it was
  agreed that Strachan should hold himself in readiness to start for
  the Western Islands about the latter end of July&#8212;Whaup being
  responsible for the provisions and champagne, whilst Tom pledged
  himself to cigars.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

  <p>I never ascertained the exact amount of the sum which Tom handed
  over to the Bailie. It must, however, have been considerable, for he
  took to retrenching his expenditure, and never once dropped a hint
  about the ten pounds which I was so singularly verdant as to lend
  him. The summer session stole away as quickly as its predecessors,
  though not, in so far as I was concerned, quite as unprofitably, for
  I got a couple of Sheriff-court papers to draw in consequence of my
  M&#39;Wilkin appearance. Tom, however, was very low about himself,
  and affected solitude. He would not join in any of the strawberry
  lunches or fish dinners so attractive to the junior members of the
  bar; but frequented the Botanical Gardens, where he might be seen any
  fine afternoon, stretched upon the bank beside the pond, concocting
  sonnets, or inscribing the name of Dorothea upon the monument
  dedicated to LinnÃ¦us.</p>

  <p>Time, however, stole on. The last man who was going to be married
  got his valedictory dinner at the close of session. Gowns were thrown
  off, wigs boxed up, and we all dispersed to the country wheresoever
  our inclination might lead us. I resolved to devote the earlier part
  of the vacation to the discovery of the town of Clackmannan&#8212;a
  place of which I had often heard, but which no human being whom I
  ever encountered had seen. Whaup was not oblivious of his promise,
  and Strachan clove unto him like a limpet.</p>

  <p>We did not meet again until September was well-nigh over. In
  common with Strachan, I had adopted the resolution of changing my
  circuit, and henceforth adhering to Glasgow, which, from its superior
  supply of criminals, is the favourite resort of our young forensic
  aspirants. So I packed my portmanteau, invoked the assistance of
  Saint Rollox, and started for the balmy west.</p>

  <p>The first man I met in George&#39;s Square was my own delightful
  Thomas. He looked rather thin; was fearfully sun-burned; had on a
  pair of canvass trowsers most wofully bespattered with tar, and
  evidently had not shaved for a fortnight.</p>

  <p>&quot;Why, Tom, my dear fellow!&quot; cried I, &quot;can this
  possibly be you? What the deuce have you been doing with yourself?
  You look as hairy as Robinson Crusoe.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;You should see Whaup,&#8212;he&#39;s rather worse off than
  Friday. We have just landed at the Broomielaw, but I was obliged to
  leave Anthony in a tavern for fear we should be mob<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>bed in
  the street. I&#39;m off by the rail to Edinburgh, to get some decent
  toggery for us both. Lend me a pound-note, will you?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Certainly&#8212;that&#39;s eleven, you recollect. But
  what&#39;s the meaning of all this? Where is the yacht?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Safe&#8212;under twenty fathoms of dark blue water, at a
  place they call the Sneeshanish Islands. Catch me going out again,
  with Anthony as steersman!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;No doubt he is an odd sort of Palinurus. But when did this
  happen?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Ten days ago. We were three days and nights upon the rock,
  with nothing to eat except two biscuits, raw mussels and
  tangle!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Mercy on us! and how did you get off?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;In a kelp-boat from Harris. But I haven&#39;t time for
  explanation just now. Go down, like a good fellow, to the Broomielaw,
  No. 431&#8212;you will find Anthony enjoying himself with beef steaks
  and bottled stout, in the back parlour of the Cat and Bagpipes. I
  must refer you to him for the details.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;One word more&#8212;you&#39;ll be back to the
  circuit?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Decidedly. To-morrow morning: as soon as I can get my things
  together.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;And the lady&#8212;What news of her?&quot;</p>

  <p>The countenance of Strachan fell.</p>

  <p>&quot;Ah, my dear friend! I wish you had not touched upon that
  string&#8212;you have set my whole frame a jarring. No trace of
  her&#8212;none&#8212;none! I fear I shall never see her
  more!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Come! don&#39;t be down-hearted. One never can tell what may
  happen. Perhaps you may meet her sooner than you think.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;You are a kind-hearted-fellow, Fred. But I&#39;ve lost all
  hope. Nothing but a dreary existence is now before me, and&#8212;but,
  by Jupiter, there goes the starting bell!&quot;</p>

  <p>Tom vanished, like Aubrey&#39;s apparition, with a melodious
  twang, and a perceptible odour of tar; and so, being determined to
  expiscate the matter, I proceeded towards the Broomielaw, and in due
  time became master of the locality of the Cat and Bagpipes.</p>

  <p>&quot;Is there a Mr Whaup here?&quot; I inquired of Mrs
  M&#39;Tavish, the landlady, who was filling a gill-stoup at the
  bar.</p>

  <p>&quot;Here you are, old chap!&quot; cried the hilarious voice of
  Anthony from an inner apartment. &quot;Turn to the right, steer clear
  of the scrubbing brushes, and help yourself to a mouthful of
  Guinness.&quot;</p>

  <p>I obeyed. Heavens, what a figure he was! His trowsers were rent
  both at the knees and elsewhere, and were kept together solely by
  means of whip-cord. His shirt had evidently not benefited by the
  removal of the excise duties upon soap, and was screened from the
  scrutiny of the beholder by an extempore paletot, fabricated out of
  sail-cloth, without the remotest apology for sleeves.</p>

  <p>Anthony, however, looked well in health, and appeared to be in
  tremendous spirits.</p>

  <p>&quot;Tip us your fin, my old coxs&#39;un!&quot; said he, winking
  at me over the rim of an enormous pewter vessel which effectually
  eclipsed the lower segment of his visage. &quot;Blessed if I
  ain&#39;t as glad to see you as one of Mother Carey&#39;s chickens in
  a squall.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Come, Anthony! leave off your nautical nonsense, and talk
  like a man of the world. What on earth have you and Tom Strachan,
  been after?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Nothing on earth, but a good deal on sea, and a trifle on as
  uncomfortable a section of basalt as ever served two unhappy
  buccaniers for bed, table, and sofa. The chilliness is not off me
  yet.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;But how did it happen?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Very simply: but I&#39;ll tell you all about it. It&#39;s a
  long story, though, so if you please I shall top off with something
  hot. I&#39;m glad you&#39;ve come, however, for I had some doubts how
  far this sort of original Petersham would inspire confidence as to my
  credit in the bosom of the fair M&#39;Tavish. It&#39;s all right now,
  however, so here goes for my yarn.&quot;</p>

  <p>But I shall not follow my friend through all the windings of his
  discourse, varied though it certainly was, like the adventures of the
  venerated Sinbad. Suffice it to say, that they were hardly out of
  sight of the Cumbraes before Tom confided the <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>whole
  tale of his sorrows to the callous Anthony, who, as he expressed it,
  had come out for a lark, and had no idea of the of rummaging the
  whole of the west coast and the adjacent islands for a petticoat.
  Moved, however, by the pathetic entreaties of Strachan, and, perhaps,
  somewhat reconciled to the quest by the dim vision of an elopement,
  Anthony magnanimously waived his objections, and the two kept
  cruising together, in a little shell of a yacht, all round the
  western Archipelago. Besides themselves, there were only a man and a
  boy on board.</p>

  <p>&quot;It was slow work,&quot; said Anthony,&#8212;&quot;deucedly
  slow. I would not have minded the thing so much if Strachan had been
  reasonably sociable; but it was rather irksome, you will allow, when,
  after the boy had brought in the kettle, and we had made every thing
  snug for the night, Master Strachan began to maunder about the
  lady&#39;s eyes, and to tear his hair, and to call himself the most
  miserable dog in existence. I had serious thoughts, at one time, of
  leaving him ashore on Mull or Skye, and making off direct to the
  Orkneys; but good-nature was always my foible, so I went on, beating
  from one place to another, as though we had been looking for the
  wreck of the Florida.</p>

  <p>&quot;I&#39;ll never take another cruise with a lover so long as I
  live. Tom led me all manner of dances, and we were twice fired at
  from farm-houses where he was caterwauling beneath the windows with a
  guitar. It seems he had heard that flame of his sing a Spanish air at
  Jedburgh. Tom must needs pick it up, and you have no idea how he
  pestered me. Go where we would, he kept harping on that abominable
  ditty, in the hopes that his mistress might hear him; and, when I
  remonstrated on the absurdity of the proceeding, he quoted the case
  of Blondel, and some trash out of Uhland&#39;s ballads. Serenading on
  the west coast is by no means a pleasant pastime. The nights are as
  raw as an anchovy, and the midges particularly plentiful.</p>

  <p>&quot;Well, sir, we could find no trace of the lady after all.
  Strachan got into low spirits, and I confess that I was sometimes
  sulky&#8212;so we had an occasional blow up, which by no means added
  to the conviviality of the voyage. One evening, just at sundown, we
  entered the Sound of Sneeshanish&#8212;an ugly place, let me tell
  you, at the best, but especially to be avoided in any thing like a
  gale of wind. The clouds in the horizon looked particularly
  threatening, and I got a little anxious, for I knew that there were
  rocks about, and not a light-house in the whole of the district.</p>

  <p>&quot;In an hour or two it grew as dark as a wolf&#39;s throat. I
  could not for the life of me make out where we were, for the Sound is
  very narrow in some parts, and occasionally I thought that I could
  hear breakers ahead.</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;Tom,&#39; said I, &#39;Tom, you lubber!&#39;&#8212;for
  our esteemed friend was, as usual, lying on the deck, with a cigar in
  his mouth, twangling at that eternal guitar&#8212;&#39;take hold of
  the helm, will you, for a minute, while I go down and look at the
  chart.&#39;</p>

  <p>&quot;I was as cold as a cucumber; so, after having ascertained,
  as I best could, the bearings about the Sound, I rather think I
  <i>did</i> stop below for one moment&#8212;but not longer&#8212;just
  to mix a glass of swizzle by way of fortification, for I didn&#39;t
  expect to get to bed that night. All of a sudden I heard a shout from
  the bows, bolted upon deck, and there, sure enough, was a black
  object right ahead, with the surf shooting over it.</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;Luff, Tom! or we are all dead men;&#8212;Luff, I
  say!&#39; shouted I. I might as well have called to a millstone. Tom
  was in a kind of trance.</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;O Dorothea!&#39; said our friend.</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;To the devil with Dorothea!&#39; roared I, snatching
  the tiller from his hand.</p>

  <p>&quot;It was too late. We went smash upon the rock, with a force
  that sent us headlong upon the deck, and Strachan staggered to his
  feet, bleeding profusely at the proboscis.</p>

  <p>&quot;Down came the sail rattling about our ears, and over lurched
  the yacht. I saw there was no time to lose, so I leaped at once upon
  the rock, and called upon the rest to follow me. They did so, and
  were lucky to escape with no more disaster than a ruffling of the
  cuticle on the basalt; for in two minutes more all was over. Some of
  the timbers had been staved in at the first concussion. She rapidly
  filled,&#8212;and down went, before my eyes, the Caption the tidiest
  little <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg
  230]</a></span>craft that ever pitched her broadside into the hull of
  a Frenchman!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Very well told indeed,&quot; said I, &quot;only, Anthony, it
  does strike me that the last paragraph is not quite original.
  I&#39;ve heard something like it in my younger days, at the Adelphi.
  But what became of you afterwards?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Faith, we were in a fix, as you may easily conceive. All we
  could do was to scramble up the rocks,&#8212;which, fortunately, were
  not too precipitous,&#8212;until we reached a dry place, where we
  lay, huddled together, until morning. When light came, we found that
  we were not on the main land, but on a kind of little stack in the
  very centre of the channel, without a blade of grass upon it, or the
  prospect of a sail in sight. This was a nice situation for two
  members of the Scottish bar! The first thing we did was to inquire
  into the state of provisions, which found to consist of a couple of
  biscuits, that little Jim, the boy, happened to have about him. Of
  course we followed the example of the earlier navigators, and
  confiscated these <i>pro bono publico</i>. We had not a drop of
  alcohol among us, but, very luckily, picked up a small keg of fresh
  water, which, I believe, was our salvation. Strachan did not behave
  well. He wanted to keep half-a-dozen cigars to himself; but such
  monstrous selfishness could not be permitted, and the rest of us took
  them from him by force. I shall always blame myself for having weakly
  restored to him a cheroot.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;And what followed?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Why, we remained three days upon the rock. Fortunately the
  weather was moderate, so that we were not absolutely washed away, but
  for all that it was consumedly cold of nights. The worst thing,
  however, was the deplorable state of our larder. We finished the
  biscuits the first day, trusting to be speedily relieved; but the sun
  set without a vestige of a sail, and we supped sparingly upon tangle.
  Next morning we were so ravenous that we could have eaten raw
  squirrels. That day we subsisted entirely upon shell-fish, and smoked
  all our cigars. On the third we bolted two old gloves, buttons and
  all; and, do you know, Fred, I began to be seriously alarmed about
  the boy Jim, for Strachan kept eying him like an ogre, began to
  mutter some horrid suggestions as to the propriety of casting lots,
  and execrated his own stupidity in being unprovided with a jar of
  pickles.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;O Anthony&#8212;for shame!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Well&#8212;I&#39;m sure he was thinking about it, if he did
  not say so. However, we lunched upon a shoe, and for my own part,
  whenever I go upon another voyage, I shall take the precaution of
  providing myself with pliable French boots&#8212;your Kilmarnock
  leather is so very intolerably tough! Towards evening, to our
  infinite joy, we descried a boat entering the Sound. We shouted, as
  you may be sure, like demons. The Celtic Samaritans came up, and,
  thanks to the kindness of Rory M&#39;Gregor the master, we each of us
  went to sleep that night with at least two gallons of oatmeal
  porridge comfortably stowed beneath our belts. And that&#39;s the
  whole history.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;And how do you feel after such unexampled
  privation?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Not a hair the worse. But this I know, that if ever I am
  caught again on such idiotical errand as hunting for a young woman
  through the Highlands, my nearest of kin are at perfect liberty to
  have me cognosced without opposition.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Ah&#8212;you are no lover, Anthony. Strachan, now, would go
  barefooted through Stony Arabia, for the mere chance of a casual
  glimpse at his mistress.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;All I can say, my dear fellow, is, that if connubial
  happiness cannot be purchased without a month&#39;s twangling on a
  guitar and three consecutive suppers upon sea-weed, I know at least
  one respectable young barrister who is likely to die unmarried. But I
  say, Fred, let us have a coach and drive up to your hotel. You can
  lend me a coat, I suppose, or something of the sort, until Strachan
  arrives; and just be good enough, will you, to settle with Mrs
  M&#39;Tavish for the bill, for, by all my hopes of a sheriffship, I
  have been thoroughly purged of my tin.&quot;</p>

  <p>The matter may not be of any especial interest to the public; at
  the same time I think it right to record the fact that Anthony Whaup
  owes me seven shillings and eightpence unto this day.<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>

  <p>&quot;That is all I can tell you about it,&quot; said Mr Hedger,
  as he handed me the last of three indictments, with the joyful
  accompaniment of the fees. &quot;That is all I can tell you about it.
  If the <i>alibi</i> will hold water, good and well&#8212;if not,
  M&#39;Closkie will be transported.&quot;</p>

  <p>Hedger is the very best criminal agent I ever met with. There is
  always a point in his cases&#8212;his precognitions are perfect, and
  pleading, under such auspices, becomes a kind of realised
  romance.</p>

  <p>&quot;By the way,&quot; said he, &quot;is there a Mr Strachan of
  your bar at circuit? I have a curious communication from a prisoner
  who is desirous to have him as her counsel.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Indeed? I am glad to hear it. Mr Strachan is a particular
  friend of mine, and will be here immediately. I shall be glad to
  introduce you. Is it a heavy case?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;No, but rather an odd one&#8212;a theft of money committed
  at the Blenheim hotel. The woman seems a person of education, but, as
  she obstinately refuses to tell me her story, I know very little more
  about it than is contained in the face of the indictment.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;What is her name?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Why you know that is a matter not very easily ascertained.
  She called herself Euphemia Saville when brought up for examination,
  and of course she will be tried as such. She is well dressed, and
  rather pretty, but she won&#39;t have any other counsel than Mr
  Strachan; and singularly enough, she has positively forbidden me to
  send him a fee on the ground that he would take it as an
  insult.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I should feel particularly obliged if the whole public would
  take to insulting me perpetually in that manner! But really this is
  an odd history. Do you think she is acquainted with my
  friend?&quot;</p>

  <p>Hedger winked.</p>

  <p>&quot;I can&#39;t say,&quot; said he &quot;for, to tell you the
  truth, I know nothing earthly about it. Only she was so extremely
  desirous to have him engaged, that I thought it not a little
  remarkable. I hope your friend won&#39;t take offence if I mention
  what the woman said?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Not in the least, you may be sure of that. And,
  <i>apropos</i>, here he comes.&quot;</p>

  <p>And in effect Whaup and Strachan now walked into the counsel&#39;s
  apartment, demure, shaven, and well dressed&#8212;altogether two very
  different looking individuals from the tatterdemalions of
  yesterday.</p>

  <p>&quot;Good morning, Fred,&quot; cried Whaup; &quot;Servant, Mr
  Hedger&#8212;lots of work going, eh? Are the pleas nearly over
  yet?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Very nearly, I believe, Mr Whaup. Would you have the
  kindness to&#8212;&#8212;&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh, certainly,&quot; said I. &quot;Strachan, allow me to
  introduce my friend Mr Hedger, who is desirous of your professional
  advice.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I say, Freddy,&quot; said Whaup, looking sulkily at the
  twain as they retired to a window to consult, &quot;what&#39;s in the
  wind now? Has old Hedger got a spite at any of his clients?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;How should I know? What do you mean?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Because I should rather think,&quot; said Anthony,
  &quot;that in our friend Strachan&#39;s hands the lad runs a
  remarkably good chance of a sea voyage to the colonies, that&#39;s
  all.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Fie for shame, Anthony! You should not bear
  malice.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;No more I do&#8212;but I can&#39;t forget the loss of the
  little Caption all through his stupid blundering; and this morning he
  must needs sleep so long that he lost the early train, and has very
  likely cut me out of business for the sheer want of a pair of
  reputable trousers.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Never mind&#8212;there is a good time coming.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Which means, I suppose, that you have got the pick of the
  cases? Very well: it can&#39;t be helped, so I shall even show myself
  in court by way of public advertisement.&quot;</p>

  <p>So saying, my long friend wrestled himself into his gown, adjusted
  his wig knowingly upon his cranium, and rushed toward the court-room
  as vehemently as though the weal of the whole criminal population of
  the west depended upon his individual exertions.<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

  <p>&quot;Freddy, come here, if you please,&quot; said Strachan,
  &quot;this is a very extraordinary circumstance! Do you know that
  this woman, Euphemia Saville, though she wishes me to act as her
  counsel, has positively refused to see me!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Very odd, certainly! Do you know her?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I never heard of the name in my life. Are you sure, Mr
  Hedger, that there is no mistake?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Quite sure, sir. She gave me, in fact, a minute description
  of your person, which perhaps I may be excused from
  repeating.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Oh, I understand,&quot; said Tom, fishingly;
  &quot;complimentary, I suppose&#8212;eh?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Why yes, rather so,&quot; replied Hedger hesitatingly; and
  he cast at the same time a glance at the limbs of my beloved friend,
  which convinced me that Miss Saville&#39;s communication had, somehow
  or other, borne reference to the shape of a parenthesis. &quot;But,
  at all events, you may be sure she has seen you. I really can imagine
  no reason for an interview. We often have people who take the same
  kind of whims, and you have no idea of their obstinacy. The best way
  will be to let the Crown lead its evidence, and trust entirely to
  cross-examination. I shall take care, at all events, that her
  appearance shall not damage her. She is well dressed, and I don&#39;t
  doubt will make use of her cambric handkerchief.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;And a very useful thing that same cambric is,&quot; observed
  I. &quot;Come, Tom, my boy, pluck up courage! You have opportunity
  now for a grand display; and if you can poke in something about
  chivalry and undefended loveliness, you may be sure it will have an
  effect on the jury. There is a strong spice of romance in the
  composition of the men of the Middle Ward.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;The whole thing, however, seems to me most
  mysterious.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Very; but that is surely an additional charm. We seldom find
  a chapter from the Mysteries of Udolfo transferred to the records of
  the Justiciary Court of Scotland.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Well, then, I suppose it must be so. Fred, will you sit
  beside me at the trial? I&#39;m not used to this sort of thing as
  yet, and I possibly may feel nervous.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Not a bit of you. At any rate I shall be there, and of
  course you may command me.&quot;</p>

  <p>In due time the cause was called. Miss Euphemia Saville ascended
  the trap stair, and took her seat between a pair of policemen with
  exceedingly luxuriant whiskers.</p>

  <p>I must allow that I felt a strong curiosity about Euphemia. Her
  name was peculiar; the circumstances under which she came forward
  were unusual; and her predilection for Strachan was tantalising. Her
  appearance, however, did little to solve the mystery. She was neatly,
  even elegantly dressed in black, with a close-fitting bonnet and
  thick veil, which at first effectually obscured her countenance.
  This, indeed, she partially removed when called upon to plead to the
  indictment; but the law of no civilised coountry that I know of is so
  savage as to prohibit the use of a handkerchief, and the fair Saville
  availed herself of the privilege by burying her countenance in
  cambric. I could only get a glimpse Of some beautiful black braided
  hair and a forehead that resembled alabaster. To all appearance she
  was extremely agitated, and sobbed as she answered to the charge.</p>

  <p>The tender-hearted Strachan was not the sort of man to behold the
  sorrows of his client without emotion. In behalf of the junior
  members of the Scottish bar I will say this, that they invariably
  fight tooth and nail when a pretty girl is concerned, and I have
  frequently heard bursts of impassioned eloquence poured forth in
  defence of a pair of bright eyes or a piquant figure, in cases where
  an elderly or wizened dame would have run a strong chance of finding
  no Cicero by her side. Tom accordingly approached the bar for the
  purpose of putting some questions to his client, but not a word could
  he extract in reply. Euphemia drew down her veil, and waved her hand
  with a repulsive gesture.</p>

  <p>&quot;I don&#39;t know what to make of her,&quot; said Strachan;
  &quot;only she seems to be a monstrous fine woman. It is clear,
  however, that she has mistaken me for somebody else. I never saw her
  in my life before.&quot;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id=
  "Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>

  <p>&quot;Hedger deserves great credit for the way he has got her up.
  Observe, Tom, there is no finery about her; no ribbons or gaudy
  scarfs, which are as unsuitable at a trial as at a funeral. Black is
  your only wear to find favour in the eyes of a jury.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;True. It is a pity that so little attention is paid to the
  Ã¦sthetics of criminal clothing. But here comes the first
  witness&#8212;Grobey I think they call him&#8212;the fellow who lost
  the money.&quot;</p>

  <p>Mr Grobey mounted the witness-box like a cow ascending a
  staircase. He was a huge, elephantine animal of some sixteen stone,
  with bushy eyebrows and a bald pate, which he ever and anon
  affectionately caressed with a red and yellow bandana. Strachan
  started at the sound of his voice, surveyed him wistfully for a
  moment, and then said to me in a hurried whisper&#8212;</p>

  <p>&quot;As I live, Fred, that is the identical bagman who boned my
  emerald studs at Jedburgh!&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;You don&#39;t mean to say it?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Fact, upon my honour! There is no mistaking his globular
  freetrading nose. Would it not be possible to object to his evidence
  on that ground?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Mercy on us! no.&#8212;Reflect&#8212;there is no
  conviction.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;True. But he stole them nevertheless. I&#39;ll ask him about
  them when I cross.&quot;</p>

  <p>Mr Grobey&#39;s narrative, however, as embraced in animated
  dialogue with the public prosecutor, threw some new and unexpected
  light upon the matter. Grobey was a traveller in the employment of
  the noted house of Barnacles, Deadeye, and Company, and perambulated
  the country for the benevolent purpose of administering to deficiency
  of vision. In the course of his wanderings, he had arrived at the
  Blenheim, where, after a light supper of fresh herrings, toasted
  cheese, and Edinburgh ale, assisted, <i>more Bagmannorum</i>, by
  several glasses of stiff brandy and water, he had retired to his
  apartment to sleep off the labours of the day. Somnus, however, did
  not descend that night with his usual lightness upon Grobey. On the
  contrary, the deity seemed changed into a ponderous weight, which lay
  heavily upon the chest of the moaning and suffocated traveller; and
  notwithstanding a paralysis which appeared to have seized upon his
  limbs, every external object in the apartment became visible to him
  as by the light of a magic lantern. He heard his watch ticking, like
  a living creature, upon the dressing-table where he had left it. His
  black morocco pocketbook was distinctly visible, beside the
  looking-glass, and two spectral boots stood up amidst the varied
  shadows of the night. Grobey was very uncomfortable. He began to
  entertain the horrid idea that a fiend was hovering, through his
  chamber.</p>

  <p>All at once he heard the door creaking upon its hinges. There was
  a slight rustling of muslin, a low sigh, and then momentary silence.
  &quot;What, in the name of John Bright, can that be?&quot; thought
  the terrified traveller; but he had not to wait long for explanation.
  The door opened slowly&#8212;a female figure, arrayed from head to
  foot in robes of virgin whiteness, glided in, and fixed her eyes,
  with an expression of deep solemnity and menace, upon the countenance
  of Grobey. He lay breathless and motionless beneath the spell. This
  might have lasted for about a minute, during which time, as Grobey
  expressed it, his very entrails were convulsed with fear. The
  apparition then moved onwards, still keeping her eyes upon the couch.
  She stood for a moment near the window, raised her arm with a
  monitory gesture to the sky, and then all at once seemed to disappear
  as it absorbed in the watery moonshine. Grobey was as bold a bagman
  as ever flanked a mare with his gig-whip, but this awful visitation
  was too much. Boots, looking-glass, and table swam with a distracting
  whirl before his eyes; he uttered a feeble yell, and immediately
  lapsed into a swoon.</p>

  <p>It was bright morning when he awoke. He started up, rubbed his
  eyes, and endeavoured to persuade himself that it was all an
  illusion. To be sure there were the boots untouched, the coat, the
  hat, and the portmanteau; but where&#8212;oh where&#8212;were the
  watch and the plethoric pocketbook, with its bunch of bank-notes and
  other minor memoranda? Gone&#8212;spirited away; and with a shout of
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg
  234]</a></span>despair old Grobey summoned the household.</p>

  <p>The police were straightway taken into his confidence. The tale of
  the midnight apparition&#8212;of the Demon Lady&#8212;was told and
  listened to, at first with somewhat of an incredulous smile; but when
  the landlord stated that an unknown damosel had been sojourning for
  two days at the hotel, that she had that morning vanished in a
  hackney-coach without leaving any trace of her address, and that,
  moreover, certain spoons of undeniable silver were amissing, Argus
  pricked up his ears, and after some few preliminary inquiries, issued
  forth in quest of the fugitive. Two days afterwards the fair Saville
  was discovered in a temperance hotel; and although the pocketbook had
  disappeared, both the recognisable notes and the watch were found in
  her possession. A number of pawn-tickets, also, which were contained
  in her reticule, served to collect from divers quarters a great mass
  of <i>bijouterie</i>, amongst which were the Blenheim spoons.</p>

  <p>Such was Mr Grobey&#39;s evidence as afterwards supplemented by
  the police. Tom rose to cross-examine.</p>

  <p>&quot;Pray, Mr Grobey,&quot; said he, adjusting his gown upon his
  shoulders with a very knowing and determined air as though he
  intended to expose his victim&#8212;&quot;Pray, Mr Grobey, are you
  any judge of studs?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I ain&#39;t a racing man,&quot; replied Grobey, &quot;but I
  knows an oss when I sees it.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Don&#39;t equivocate, sir, if you please. Recollect you are
  upon your oath,&quot; said Strachan, irritated by a slight titter
  which followed upon Grobey&#39;s answer. &quot;I mean studs,
  sir&#8212;emerald studs for example?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I ain&#39;t. But the lady is,&quot; replied Grobey.</p>

  <p>&quot;How do you mean, sir?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;Cos there vos five pair on them taken out of pawn with
  her tickets.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;How do you know that, sir?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;&#39;Cos I seed them.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Were you at Jedburgh, sir, in the month of April
  last?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I was.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Do you recollect seeing me there?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Perfectly.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Do you remember what passed upon that occasion?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;You was rather confluscated, I think.&quot;</p>

  <p>There was a general laugh.</p>

  <p>&quot;Mr Strachan,&quot; said the judge mildly, &quot;I am always
  sorry to interrupt a young counsel, but I really cannot see the
  relevancy of these questions. The Court can have nothing to do with
  your communications with the witness. I presume I need not take a
  note of these latter answers.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Very well, my lord,&quot; said Tom, rather discomfited at
  being cut out of his revenge on the bagman, &quot;I shall ask him
  something else;&quot; and he commenced his examination in right
  earnest. Grobey, however, stood steadfast to the letter of his
  previous testimony.</p>

  <p>Another witness was called; and to my surprise the Scottish Vidocq
  appeared. He spoke to the apprehension and the search, and also to
  the character of the prisoner. In his eyes she had long been
  chronicled as habit and repute a thief.</p>

  <p>&quot;You know the prisoner then?&quot; said Strachan rising.</p>

  <p>&quot;I do. Any time these three years.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Under what name is she known to you?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Betsy Brown is her real name, but she has gone by twenty
  others.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;By twenty, do you say?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;There or thereabouts. She always flies at high game; and,
  being a remarkably clever woman, she passes herself off for a
  lady.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Have you ever seen her elsewhere than in Glasgow?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I have.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Where?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;At Jedburgh.&quot;</p>

  <p>I cannot tell what impulse it was that made me twitch
  Strachan&#39;s gown at this moment. It was not altogether a
  suspicion, but rather a presentiment of coming danger. Strachan took
  the hint and changed his line.</p>

  <p>&quot;Can you specify any of her other names?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;I can. There are half-a-dozen of them here on the
  pawn-tickets. Shall I read them?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;If you please.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;One diamond ring, pledged in name of Lady Emily Delaroche. A
  garnet brooch and chain&#8212;Miss Maria <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg
  235]</a></span>Mortimer. Three gold seals&#8212;Mrs Markham Vere. A
  watch and three emerald studs&#8212;the Honourable Dorothea
  Percy&#8212;&#8212;&quot;</p>

  <p>There was a loud shriek from the bar, and a bustle&#8212;the
  prisoner had fainted.</p>

  <p>I looked at Strachan. He was absolutely as white as a corpse.</p>

  <p>&quot;My dear Tom,&quot; said I, &quot;hadn&#39;t you better go
  out into the open air?&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;No!&quot; was the firm reply; &quot;I am here to do my duty,
  and I&#39;ll do it.&quot;</p>

  <p>And in effect, the Spartan boy with the fox gnawing into his side,
  did not acquit himself more heroically than my friend. The case was a
  clear one, no doubt, but Tom made a noble speech, and was highly
  complimented by the Judge upon his ability. No sooner, however, had
  he finished it than he left the Court.</p>

  <p>I saw him two hours afterwards.</p>

  <p>&quot;Tom,&quot; said I, &quot;About these emerald studs&#8212;I
  think I could get them back from the Fiscal.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Keep them to yourself. I&#39;m off to India.&quot;</p>

  <p>&quot;Bah!&#8212;go down to the Highlands for a month.&quot;</p>

  <p>Tom did so; purveyed himself a kilt; met an heiress at the
  Inverness Meeting, and married her. He is now the happy father of
  half-a-dozen children, and a good many of us would give a trifle for
  his practice. But to this day he is as mad as a March hare if an
  allusion is made in his presence to any kind of studs whatsoever.</p>

  <p>Although Dr Reid does not stand in the very highest rank of
  philosophers, this incomparable edition of his works goes far to
  redress his deficiencies, and to render his writings, taken in
  connexion with the editorial commentaries, a most engaging and
  profitable study. It is probable that the book derives much of its
  excellence from the very imperfections of the textual author. Had
  Reid been a more learned man, he might have failed to elicit the
  unparalleled erudition of his editor,&#8212;had he been a clearer and
  closer thinker, Sir William Hamilton&#39;s vigorous logic and
  speculative acuteness, would probably have found a narrower field for
  their display. On the whole, we cannot wish that Reid had been either
  more erudite or more perspicacious, so pointed and felicitous is the
  style in which his errors are corrected, his thoughts reduced to
  greater precision, his ambiguities pointed out and cleared up, and
  his whole system set in its most advantageous light, by his admiring,
  though by no means idolatrous editor.</p>

  <p>Besides being a model of editorship, this single volume is, in so
  far as philosophy and the history of philosophical opinion are
  concerned, of itself a literature. We must add, however, that Sir
  William Hamilton&#39;s dissertations, though abundant, are not yet
  completed. Yet, in spite of this drawback, the work is one which
  ought to wipe away effectually from our country the reproach of
  imperfect learning and shallow speculation; for in depth of thought,
  and extent and accuracy of knowledge, the editor&#39;s own
  contributions are of themselves sufficient to bring up our national
  philosophy (which had fallen somewhat into arrear) to a level with
  that of the most scientific countries in Europe.</p>

  <p>In the remarks that are to follow, we shall confine ourselves to a
  critique of the philosophy of Dr Reid, and of its collateral topics.
  Sir William Hamilton&#39;s dissertations are too elaborate and
  important to be discussed, unless in an article, or series of
  articles, devoted exclusively to themselves. Should we appear in
  aught to press the philosophy of common sense too hard, we conceive
  that our strictures are, to a considerable extent, borne out by the
  admissions of Sir William Hamilton himself, in regard to the tenets
  of the founder of the school. And should some of our shafts glance
  off against the editor&#39;s own opinions, he has only himself to
  blame for it. If we see a fatal flaw in the constitution of all, and
  consequently of his, psychology, it was his writings that first
  opened our eyes to it. So lucidly has he explained certain
  philosophical doctrines, that they cannot stop at the point to which
  he has carried them. They must be rolled forward into a new
  development which perhaps may be at variance with the old one, where
  he tarries. But his powerful arm first set the stone in motion, and
  he must be content to let it travel whithersoever it may. He has
  taught those who study him <i>to think</i>&#8212;and he must stand
  the consequences, whether they think in unison with himself or not.
  We, conceive, however, that even those who differ from him most,
  would readily own, that to his instructive disquisitions they were
  indebted for at least one half of all that they know of
  philosophy.</p>

  <p>In entering on an examination of the system of Dr Reid, we must
  ask first of all, what is the great problem about which philosophers
  in all ages have busied themselves most, and which consequently must
  have engaged, and did engage, a large share of the attention of the
  champion of Common Sense? We must also state the <i>fact</i> which
  gives rise to the problem of philosophy.</p>

  <p>The perception of a material universe, as it is the most prominent
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg
  240]</a></span>fact of cognition, so has it given rise to the problem
  which has been most agitated by philosophers. This question does not
  relate to the existence of the fact. The existence of the perception
  of matter is admitted on all hands. It refers to the nature, or
  origin, or constitution of the fact. Is the perception of matter
  simple and indivisible, or is it composite and divisible? Is it the
  ultimate, or is it only the penultimate, <i>datum</i> of cognition?
  Is it a relation constituted by the concurrence of a mental or
  subjective, and a material or objective element,&#8212;or do we
  impose upon ourselves in regarding it as such? Is it a state, or
  modification of the human mind? Is it an effect that can be
  distinguished from its cause? Is it an event consequent on the
  presence of real antecedent objects? These interrogations are
  somewhat varied in their form, but each of them embodies the whole
  point at issue, each of them contains the cardinal question of
  philosophy. The perception of matter is the admitted fact. The
  <i>character</i> of this fact&#8212;that is the point which
  speculation undertakes to canvass, and endeavours to decipher.</p>

  <p>Another form in which the question may be put is this: We all
  believe in the existence of matter&#8212;but what <i>kind</i> of
  matter do we believe in the existence of? matter <i>per se</i>, or
  matter <i>cum perceptione</i>? If the former&#8212;this implies that
  the given fact (the perception of matter) is compound and submits to
  analysis; if the latter&#8212;this implies that it is simple and
  defies partition.</p>

  <p>Opposite answers to this question are returned by psychology and
  metaphysics. In the estimation of metaphysic, the perception of
  matter is the absolutely elementary in cognition, the <i>ne plus
  ultra</i> of thought. Reason cannot get beyond, or behind it. It has
  no pedigree. It admits of no analysis. It is not a relation
  constituted by the coalescence of an objective and a subjective
  element. It is not a state or modification of the human mind. It is
  not an effect which can be distinguished from its cause. It is not
  brought about by the presence of antecedent realities. It is
  positively the <span class='smcap'>first</span>, with no forerunner.
  The perception-of-matter is one mental word, of which the verbal
  words are mere syllables. We impose upon ourselves, and we also
  falsify the fact, if we take any other view of it than this. Thus
  speaks metaphysic, though perhaps not always with an unfaltering
  voice.</p>

  <p>Psychology, or the science of the human mind, teaches a very
  different doctrine. According to this science, the perception of
  matter is a secondary and composite truth. It admits of being
  analysed into a subjective and an objective element&#8212;a mental
  modification called perception on the one hand, and matter <i>per
  se</i> on the other. It is an effect induced by real objects. It is
  not the first <i>datum</i> of intelligence. It has matter itself for
  its antecedent. Such, in very general terms, is the explanation of
  the perception of matter which psychology proposes.</p>

  <p>Psychology and metaphysics are thus radically opposed to each
  other in their solutions of the highest problem of speculation.
  Stated concisely, the difference between them is
  this:&#8212;psychology regards the perception of matter as
  susceptible of analytic treatment, and travels, or endeavours to
  travel, beyond the given fact: metaphysic stops short in the given
  fact, and there makes a stand, declaring it to be all indissoluble
  unity. Psychology holds her analysis to be an analysis of things.
  Metaphysic holds the psychological analysis to be an analysis of
  sounds&#8212;and nothing more.</p>

  <p>These observations exhibit, in their loftiest generalisation, the
  two counter doctrines on the subject of perception. We now propose to
  follow them into their details, for the purpose both of eliciting the
  truth and of arriving at a correct judgment in regard to the
  reformation which Dr Reid is supposed to have effected in this
  department of philosophy.</p>

  <p>The psychological or analytic doctrine is the first which we shall
  discuss, on account of its connexion with the investigations of Dr
  Reid,&#8212;in regard to whom we may state, beforehand, our
  conclusion and its grounds, which are these:&#8212;that Reid broke
  down in his philosophy, both polemical and positive, because he
  assumed the psychological and not the metaphysical doctrine of
  perception as the basis of his <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>arguments. He did not
  regard the perception of matter as absolutely primary and simple; but
  in common with all psychologists, he conceived that it admitted of
  being resolved into a mental condition, and a material reality; and
  the consequence was, that he fell into the very errors which it was
  the professed business of his life to denounce and exterminate. How
  this catastrophe came about we shall endeavour shortly to
  explain.</p>

  <p>Reid&#39;s leading design was to overthrow scepticism and
  idealism. In furtherance of this intention, he proposed to himself
  the accomplishment of two subsidiary ends,&#8212;the refutation of
  what is called the ideal or representative theory of perception, and
  the substitution of a doctrine of intuitive perception in its room.
  He takes, and he usually gets, credit for having accomplished both of
  these objects. But if it be true that the representative theory is
  but the inevitable development of the doctrine which treats the
  perception of matter analytically, and if it be true that Reid adopts
  this latter doctrine, it is obvious that his claims cannot be
  admitted without a very considerable deduction. That both of these
  things are true may be established, we think, beyond the possibility
  of a doubt.</p>

  <p>In the first place, then, we have to show that the theory of a
  representative perception (which Reid is supposed to have overthrown)
  is identical with the doctrine which treats the perception of matter
  analytically;&#8212;and, in the second, we have to show that Reid
  himself followed the analytic or psychological procedure in his
  treatment of this fact, and founded upon the analysis his own
  doctrine of perception.</p>

  <p><i>First</i>, The representative theory is that doctrine of
  perception which teaches that, in our intercourse with the external
  universe, we are not immediately cognisant of real objects
  themselves, but only of certain mental transcripts or images of them,
  which, in the language of the different philosophical schools, were
  termed ideas, representations, phantasms, or species. According to
  this doctrine we are cognisant of real things, not in and through
  themselves, but in and through these species or representations. The
  representations are the immediate or proximate, the real things are
  the mediate or remote, objects of the mind. The existence of the
  former is a matter of knowledge, the existence of the latter is
  merely a matter of belief.</p>

  <p>To understand this theory, we must construe its nomenclature into,
  the language of the present day. What, then, is the modern synonym
  for the &quot;ideas,&quot; &quot;representations,&quot;
  &quot;phantasms,&quot; and &quot;species,&quot; which the theory in
  question declares to be vicarious of real objects? There cannot be a
  doubt that the word <i>perception</i> is that synonym. So that the
  representative theory, when fairly interpreted, amounts simply to
  this;&#8212;that the mind is immediately cognisant, not of real
  objects themselves, but <i>only of its own perceptions of real
  objects</i>. To accuse the representationist of maintaining a
  doctrine more repugnant to common sense than this, or in any way
  different from it, would be both erroneous and unjust. The golden
  rule of philosophical criticism is, to give every system the benefit
  of the most favourable interpretation which it admits of.</p>

  <p>This, then, is the true version of
  representationism,&#8212;namely, that our perceptions of material
  things, and not material things <i>per se</i>, are the proximate
  objects of our consciousness when we hold intercourse with the
  external universe.</p>

  <p>Now, this is a doctrine which inevitably emerges the instant that
  the analysis of the perception of matter is set on foot and admitted.
  When a philosopher divides, or imagines that he divides, the
  perception of matter into two things, perception <i>and</i> matter,
  holding the former to be a state of his own mind, and the latter to
  be no such state; he does, in that analysis, and without saying one
  other word, avow himself to be a thoroughgoing representationist. For
  his analysis declares that, in perception, the mind has an immediate
  or proximate, and a mediate or remote object. Its perception of
  matter is the proximate object&#8212;the object of its consciousness;
  matter itself, the material existence, is the remote object&#8212;the
  object of its belief. But such a doctrine is representationism, in
  the strictest sense of the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242"
  id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>word. It is the very essence and
  definition of the representative theory to recognise, in perception,
  a remote as well as a proximate object of the mind. Every system
  which does this, is necessarily a representative system. The doctrine
  which treats the perception of matter analytically does this;
  therefore the analytic or psychological doctrine is identical with
  the representative theory. Both hold that the perceptive process
  involves two objects&#8212;an immediate and a mediate; and nothing
  more is required to establish their perfect identity. The analysis of
  the fact which we call the perception of matter, is unquestionably
  the groundwork and pervading principle of the theory of a
  representative perception, whatever form of expression this scheme
  may at any time have assumed.</p>

  <p><i>Secondly</i>, Did Dr Reid go to work analytically in his
  treatment of the perception of matter? Undoubtedly he did. He
  followed the ordinary psychological practice. He regarded the
  <i>datum</i> as divisible into perception and matter. The perception
  he held to be an act, if not a modification, of our minds; the
  matter, he regarded as something which existed out of the mind and
  irrespective of all perception. Right or wrong, he resolved, or
  conceived that he had resolved, the perception of matter into its
  constituent elements&#8212;these being a mental operation on the one
  hand, and a material existence on the other. In short, however
  ambiguous many of Dr Reid&#39;s principles may be, there can be no
  doubt that he founded his doctrine of perception on an analysis of
  the given fact with which he had to deal. He says, indeed, but little
  about this analysis, so completely does he take it for granted. He
  accepted, as a thing of course, the notorious distinction between the
  perception of matter and matter itself: and, in doing so, he merely
  followed the example of all preceding psychologists.</p>

  <p>These two points being established,&#8212;<i>first</i>, that the
  theory of representationism necessarily arises out of an analysis of
  the perception of matter; and <i>secondly</i>, that Reid analysed or
  accepted the analysis of this fact,&#8212;it follows as a necessary
  consequence, that Reid, so far from having overthrown the
  representative theory, was himself a representationist. His analysis
  gave him more than he bargained for. He wished to obtain only one,
  that is, only a proximate object in perception; but his analysis
  necessarily gave him two: it gave him a remote as well as a proximate
  object. The mental mode or operation which he calls the perception of
  matter, and which he distinguishes from matter itself, this, in his
  philosophy, is the proximate object of consciousness, and is
  precisely equivalent to the species, phantasms, representations of
  the older psychology; the real existence, matter itself, which he
  distinguishes from the perception of it, this is the remote object of
  the mind, and is precisely equivalent to the mediate or represented
  object of the older psychology. He and the representationists,
  moreover, agree in holding that the latter is the object of belief
  rather than of knowledge.</p>

  <p>The merits of Dr Reid, then, as a reformer of philosophy, amount
  in our opinion to this:&#8212;he was among the first<a name=
  "FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23"
  class="fnanchor">[23]</a> to <i>say</i> and to <i>write</i> that the
  representative theory of perception was false and erroneous, and was
  the fountainhead of scepticism and idealism. But this admission of
  his merits must be accompanied by the qualification that he adopted,
  as the basis of his philosophy, a principle which rendered nugatory
  all his protestations. It is of no use to disclaim a conclusion if we
  accept the premises which inevitably lead to it. Dr Reid <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg
  243]</a></span>disclaimed the representative theory, but he embraced
  its premises, and thus he virtually ratified the conclusions of the
  very system which he clamourously denounced. In his language, he is
  opposed to representationism, but in his doctrine, he lends it the
  strongest support, by accepting as the foundation of his philosophy
  an analysis of the perception of matter.</p>

  <p>In regard to the <i>second</i> end which Dr Reid is supposed to
  have overtaken,&#8212;the establishment of a doctrine of intuitive as
  opposed to a doctrine of representative perception, it is unnecessary
  to say much. If we have proved him to be a representationist, he
  cannot be held to be an intuitionist. Indeed, a doctrine of intuitive
  perception is a sheer impossibility upon his principles. A doctrine
  of intuition implies that the mind in perceiving matter has only one,
  namely, a proximate object. But the analysis of the perception of
  matter yields as its result, a remote as well as a proximate object.
  The proximate object is the perception&#8212;the remote object is the
  reality. And thus the analysis of the given fact necessarily renders
  abortive every endeavour to construct a doctrine of intuitive
  perception. The attempt <i>must</i> end in representationism. The
  only basis for a doctrine of intuitive perception which will never
  give way, is a resolute forbearance from all analysis of the fact. Do
  not tamper with it, and you are safe.</p>

  <p>Such is the judgment which we are reluctantly compelled to
  pronounce on the philosophy of Dr Reid in reference to its two
  cardinal claims&#8212;the refutation of the ideal theory, and the
  establishment of a truer doctrine&#8212;a doctrine of intuitive
  perception. In neither of these undertakings do we think that he has
  succeeded, and we have exhibited the grounds of our opinion. We do
  not blame him for this: he simply missed his way at the outset.
  Representationism could not possibly be avoided, neither could
  intuitionism be possibly fallen in with, on the analytic road which
  he took.</p>

  <p>But we have not yet done with the consideration of the
  psychological or analytic doctrine of perception. We proceed to
  examine the entanglements in which reason gets involved when she
  accepts the perception of matter not in its natural and indissoluble
  unity, but as analysed by philosophers into a mental and a material
  factor. We have still an eye to Dr Reid. He came to the rescue of
  reason&#8212;how did it fare with him in the struggle?</p>

  <p>The analysis so often referred to affords a starting point, as has
  been shown, to representationism: it is also the tap-root of
  scepticism and idealism. These four things hang together in an
  inevitable sequence. Scepticism and idealism dog representationism,
  and representationism dogs the analysis of the perception of matter,
  just as obstinately as substance is dogged by shadow. More explicitly
  stated, the order in which they move is this:&#8212;The analysis
  divides the perception of matter into perception and matter&#8212;two
  separate things. Upon this, representationism declares, that the
  perception is the proximate and that the matter is the remote object
  of the mind. Then scepticism declares, that the existence of the
  matter which has been separated from the perception is problematical,
  because it is not the direct object of consciousness, and is
  consequently hypothetical. And, last of all, idealism takes up the
  ball and declares, that this hypothetical matter is not only
  problematical, but that it is non-existent. These are the
  perplexities which rise up to embarrass reason whenever she is weak
  enough to accept from philosophers their analysis of the perception
  of matter. They are only the just punishment of her infatuated
  facility. But what has Reid done to extricate reason from her
  embarrassments?</p>

  <p>We must remember that Reid commenced with analysis, and that
  consequently he embraced representationism,&#8212;in its spirit, if
  not positively in its letter. But how did he evade the fangs of
  scepticism and idealism&#8212;to say nothing of
  destroying&#8212;these sleuth-hounds which on this road were sure to
  be down upon his track the moment they got wind of him? We put the
  question in a less figurative form,&#8212;When scepticism
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg
  244]</a></span>and idealism doubted or denied the independent
  existence of matter, how did Reid vindicate it? He faced about and
  appealed boldly to our instinctive and irresistible <i>belief</i> in
  its independent existence.</p>

  <p>The crisis of the strife centres in this appeal. In itself, the
  appeal is perfectly competent and legitimate. But it may be met, on
  the part of the sceptic and idealist, by two modes of tactic. The one
  tactic is weak, and gives an easy triumph to Dr Reid: the other is
  more formidable, and, in our opinion, lays him prostrate.</p>

  <p><i>The first Sceptical Tactic.</i> In answer to Dr Reid&#39;s
  appeal, the sceptic or idealist may say, &quot;Doubtless we have a
  belief in the independent existence of matter; but this belief is not
  to be trusted. It is an insufficient guarantee for that which it
  avouches. It does not follow that a thing is true because we
  instinctively believe it to be true. It does not follow that matter
  exists because we cannot but believe it to exist. You must prove its
  existence by a better argument than mere belief.&quot;&#8212;This
  mode of meeting the appeal we hold to be pure trifling. We join issue
  with Dr Reid in maintaining that our nature is not rooted in
  delusion, and that the primitive convictions of common sense, must be
  accepted as infallible. If the sceptic admits that we <i>have</i> a
  natural belief in the independent existence of matter, there is an
  end to him: Dr Reid&#39;s victory is secure. This first tactic is a
  feeble and mistaken man&#339;uvre.</p>

  <p><i>The Second Sceptical Tactic.</i> This position is not so easily
  turned. The stronghold of the sceptic and idealist is this: they deny
  the primitive belief to which Dr Reid appeals to be <i>the fact</i>.
  It is not true, they say, that any man believes in the independent
  existence of matter. And this is perfectly obvious the moment that it
  is explained. Matter in its <i>independent</i> existence, matter
  <i>per se</i>, is matter disengaged in thought from all perception of
  it present or remembered. Now, does any man believe in the existence
  of such matter? Unquestionably not. No man by any possibility can.
  What the matter is which man really believes in shall be explained
  when we come to speak of the metaphysical solution of the
  problem&#8212;perhaps sooner. Meanwhile we remark that Dr Reid&#39;s
  appeal to the conviction of common sense in favour of the existence
  of matter <i>per se</i>, is rebutted, and in our opinion
  triumphantly, by the denial on the part of scepticism and idealism
  that any such belief exists. Scepticism and idealism not only deny
  the independent existence of matter, but they deny that any man
  believes in the independent existence of matter. And in this denial
  they are most indubitably right. For observe what such a belief
  requires as its condition. A man must disengage in thought, a tree,
  for instance, from the thought of all perception of it, and then he
  must believe in its existence thus disengaged. If he has not
  disengaged, in his mind, the tree from its perception, (from its
  present perception, if the tree be before him&#8212;from its
  remembered perception, if it be not before him,) he cannot believe in
  the existence of the tree disengaged from its perception; for the
  tree is not disengaged from its perception. But unless he believes in
  the existence of the tree disengaged from its perception, he does not
  believe in the independent existence of the tree,&#8212;in the
  existence of the tree <i>per se</i>. Now, can the mind by any effort
  effect this disengagement? The thing is an absolute impossibility.
  The condition on which the belief hinges cannot be purified, and
  consequently the belief itself cannot be entertained.</p>

  <p>People have, then, <i>no belief</i> in the independent existence
  of matter&#8212;that is, in the existence of matter entirely denuded
  of perception. This point being proved, what becomes of Dr Reid&#39;s
  appeal to <i>this belief</i> in support of matter&#39;s independent
  existence? It has not only no force; it has no meaning. This second
  tactic is invincible. Scepticism and idealism are perfectly in the
  right when they refuse to accept as the guarantee of independent
  matter a belief which itself has no manner of existence. How can they
  be vanquished by an appeal to a nonentity?</p>

  <p>A question may here be raised. If <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>the belief in question be
  not the fact, what has hitherto prevented scepticism from putting a
  final extinguisher on Reid&#39;s appeal by <i>proving</i> that no
  such belief exists? A very sufficient reason has prevented
  scepticism, from doing this&#8212;from explicitly extinguishing the
  appeal. There is a division of labour in speculation as well as in
  other pursuits. It is the sceptic&#39;s business simply to deny the
  existence of the belief: it is no part of his business to exhibit the
  grounds of his denial. <i>We</i> have explained these grounds; but
  were the sceptic to do this, he would be travelling out of his
  vocation. Observe how the case stands. The reason why matter <i>per
  se</i> is not and cannot be believed in, is because it is impossible
  for thought to disengage matter from perception, and consequently it
  is impossible for thought to believe in the disengaged existence of
  matter. The matter to be, believed in is not disengaged from the
  perception, consequently it cannot be believed to be disengaged from
  the perception. But unless it be believed to be disengaged from the
  perception, it cannot be believed to exist <i>per se</i>. In short,
  as we have already said, the impossibility of complying with the
  <i>condition</i> of the belief is the ground on which the sceptic
  denies the <i>existence</i> of the belief. But the sceptic is himself
  debarred from producing these grounds. Why? Because their exhibition
  would be tantamount to a rejection of the principle which he has
  <i>accepted</i> at the hands of the orthodox and dogmatic
  psychologist. That principle is the analysis so often spoken
  of&#8212;the separation, namely, of the perception of matter into
  perception and matter <i>per se</i>. The sceptic accepts this
  analysis. His business is simply to <i>accept</i>, not to discover or
  scrutinise principles. Having accepted the analysis, he then denies
  that any belief attaches to the existence of matter <i>per se</i>. In
  this he is quite right. But he cannot, consistently with his calling,
  exhibit the ground of his denial; for this ground is, as we have
  shown, the impossibility of performing the analysis,&#8212;of
  effecting the requisite disengagement. But the sceptic has accepted
  the analysis, has admitted the disengagement. He therefore cannot now
  retract: and he has no wish to retract. His special mission&#8212;his
  only object is to confound the principle which he has accepted by
  means of the reaction of its consequence. The inevitable consequence
  which ensues when the analysis of the perception of matter is
  admitted is the extinction of all belief in the existence of matter.
  The analysis gives us a kind of matter to believe in to which no
  belief corresponds. The sceptic is content with pronouncing this to
  be the fact without going into its reason. It is not his business to
  correct, by a direct exposure, the error of the principle which the
  dogmatist lays down, and which he accepts. The analysis is the
  psychologist&#39;s affair; let <i>him</i> look to it. Were the
  sceptic to make it his, he would emerge, from the sceptical crisis,
  and pass into a new stage of speculation. He, indeed, subverts it
  indirectly by a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>. But he does not
  <i>say</i> that he subverts it&#8212;he leaves the orthodox proposer
  of the principle to find that out.</p>

  <p>Reid totally misconceived the nature of scepticism and idealism in
  their bearings on this problem. He regarded them as habits of
  thought&#8212;as dispositions of mind peculiar to certain individuals
  of vexatious character and unsound principles, instead of viewing
  them as catholic eras in the development of all genuine speculative
  thinking. In his eyes they were subjective crotchets limited to some,
  and not objective crises common to all, who think. He made
  <i>personal</i> matters of them&#8212;a thing not to be endured. For
  instance, in dealing with Hume, he conceived that the scepticism
  which confronted him in the pages of that great genius, was
  <i>Hume&#39;s</i> scepticism, and was not the scepticism of human
  nature at large,&#8212;was not his own scepticism just as much as it
  was Hume&#39;s. <i>His</i> soul, so he thought, was free from the
  obnoxious flaw, merely because <i>his</i> anatomy, shallower than
  Hume&#39;s, refused to lay it bare. With such views it was impossible
  for Reid to eliminate scepticism and idealism from philosophy. These
  foes are the foes of each man&#39;s own house and heart, and
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg
  246]</a></span>nothing can be made of them if we attack them in the
  person of another. Ultimately and fairly to get rid of them, a man
  must first of all thoroughly digest them, and take them up into the
  vital circulation of his own reason. The only way of putting them
  back is by carrying them forward.</p>

  <p>From having never properly secreted scepticism and idealism in his
  own mind, Reid fell into the commission of one of the gravest errors
  of which a philosopher can be guilty. He falsified the fact in regard
  to our primitive beliefs&#8212;a thing which the obnoxious systems
  against which he was fighting never did. He conceived that scepticism
  and idealism called in question a fact which was countenanced by a
  natural belief; accordingly, he confronted their denial with the
  allegation that the disputed fact&#8212;the existence of matter
  <i>per se</i>&#8212;was guaranteed by a primitive conviction of our
  nature. But this fact receives no support from any such source. There
  is no belief in the whole repository of the mind which can be fitted
  on to the existence of matter denuded of all perception. Therefore,
  in maintaining the contrary, Reid falsified the fact in regard to our
  primitive convictions&#8212;in regard to those principles of common
  sense which he professed to follow as his guide. This was a serious
  slip. The rash step which he here took plunged him into a much deeper
  error than that of the sceptic or idealist. They err<a name=
  "FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24"
  class="fnanchor">[24]</a> in common with him in accepting as their
  starting-point the analysis of the perception of matter. He errs, by
  himself, in maintaining that there is a belief where no belief
  exists.</p>

  <p>But do not scepticism and idealism doubt matter&#39;s existence
  <i>altogether</i>, or deny to it <i>any</i> kind of existence?
  Certainly they do; and in harmony with the principle from which they
  start they must do this. The <i>only</i> kind of matter which the
  analysis of the perception of matter yields, is matter <i>per se</i>.
  The existence of such matter is, as we have shown, altogether
  uncountenanced either by consciousness or belief. But there is no
  other kind of matter in the field. We must therefore either believe
  in the existence of matter <i>per se</i>, or we must believe in the
  existence of <i>no</i> matter whatever. We do not, and we cannot
  believe in the existence of matter <i>per se</i>; therefore, we
  cannot believe in the existence of matter at all. This is not
  satisfactory, but it is closely consequential.</p>

  <p>But why not, it may be said&#8212;why not cut the knot, and set
  the question at rest, by admitting at once that every man
  <i>does</i>, popularly speaking, believe in the existence of matter,
  and that he practically walks in the light of that belief during
  every moment of his life? This observation tempts us into a
  digression, and we shall yield to the temptation. The problem of
  perception admits of being treated in <i>three</i> several ways:
  <i>first</i>, we may ignore it altogether,&#8212;we may refuse to
  entertain it at all; or, <i>secondly</i>, we may discuss it in the
  manner just proposed&#8212;we may lay it down as gospel that everyman
  does believe in the existence of matter, and acts at all times upon
  this conviction, and we may expatiate diffusely over these smooth
  truths; or, <i>thirdly</i>, we may follow and contemplate the subtle
  and often perplexed windings which reason takes in working her way
  through the problem&#8212;a problem which, though apparently clearer
  than the noonday sun, is really darker than the mysteries of Erebus.
  In short, we may <i>speculate</i> the problem. In grappling with it,
  we may trust ourselves to the mighty current of <i>thinking</i>, with
  all its whirling eddies,&#8212;certain that if our thinking be
  genuine objective thinking, which deals with nothing but
  <i>ascertained</i> facts&#8212;it will bring us at last into the
  haven of truth. We now propose to consider which of these modes of
  treating the problem is the best; we shall begin by making a few
  remarks upon the <i>second</i>, for it was this which brought us to a
  stand, and seduced us into the present digression.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg
  247]</a></span></p>

  <p>It is, no doubt, perfectly true, that we all believe in the
  existence of matter, and that we all act up to this belief. But
  surely that statement is not a thing, to be put into a book and
  <i>sold</i>. It is not even a thing which one man is entitled to tell
  <i>gratuitously</i> to another man who knows it just as well as he
  does. It must be admitted upon a moment&#39;s reflection, that to
  communicate such information is to trifle with people&#39;s patience
  in an intolerable degree, is to trespass most abominably upon public
  or upon private indulgence. What, then, shall we say, when we find
  this kind of truth not only gravely imparted, but vehemently
  reiterated and enforced by scientific men, as it is in the pages of
  Dr Reid and other celebrated expounders of the philosophy of the
  human mind? We shall only say, that the economy of science is less
  understood than that of commerce; and that while material articles,
  such as air and sunshine, which are accessible to all, are for that
  reason excluded from the market of trade, many intellectual wares,
  which are at least equally accessible, are most preposterously
  permitted to have a place in the market of science. Such wares are
  the instinctive principles of Dr Reid. To inform a man that the
  material universe exists, and that he believes in its existence, is
  to take for granted that he is an idiot.</p>

  <p>The circumstance which led the philosophers of Common Sense to
  traffic in this kind of article, was perhaps the notion that truths
  had a value in communication in proportion to their <i>importance</i>
  to mankind. But that is a most mistaken idea. The most important
  truths have absolutely no value in communication. The truth that
  &quot;each of us exists&quot;&#8212;the truth &quot;that each of us
  is the same person to-day that he was yesterday,&quot; the truth that
  &quot;a material universe exists, and that we believe in its
  existence,&quot;&#8212;all these are most important truths&#8212;most
  important things to know. It is difficult to see how we could get on
  without this knowledge. Yet they are not worth one straw in
  communication. And why not? Just for the same reason that atmospheric
  air, though absolutely indispensable to our existence, has no value
  whatever in exchange&#8212;this reason being that we can get, and
  have already got, both the air and the truths, in unlimited abundance
  for nothing,&#8212;and thanks to no man. Why <i>give</i> a man what
  he has already <i>got</i> to his heart&#39;s content&#8212;why
  <i>teach</i> him what he already <i>knows</i> even to repletion?</p>

  <p>It is not its importance, then, which confers upon truth its value
  in communication. In other words, it is a most superfluous civility
  for one man to impart truth to another, solely because it happens to
  be important. If the important truth be already perfectly well known
  to the recipient, and if the imparter of it is aware that the
  recipient knows it just as well as he does,&#8212;&quot;thank you
  <i>for nothing</i>&quot; is, we think, the mildest reply that could
  be made in the circumstances. The fact is, that the value of truth is
  measured by precisely the same standard which determines the value of
  wealth. This standard is in neither case the importance of the
  article,&#8212;it is always its difficulty of attainment,&#8212;its
  cost of production. Has <i>labour</i> been expended on its formation
  or acquisition; then the article, if a material commodity, has a
  value in exchange&#8212;if a truth, it has a value in communication.
  Has no labour been bestowed upon it, and has Nature herself furnished
  it to every human being in overflowing abundance, then the thing is
  altogether destitute of exchange-value&#8212;whether it be an article
  of matter or of mind. No man can, without impertinence, transmit or
  convey such a commodity to his neighbour.</p>

  <p>If this be the law on the subject, (and we conceive that it must
  be so ruled) it settles the question as to the <i>second</i> mode of
  dealing with the problem of perception. It establishes the point that
  this method of treating the problem is not to be permitted. It is
  <i>tabooed</i> by the very nature of things. Air and sunshine are
  excellent and most important articles, but they are not things to
  carry to market in bottles,&#8212;because no labour is required to
  produce them, and because they are the gratuitous and abundant
  property of every living soul. In the same way, the existence
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg
  248]</a></span>of a material universe&#8212;and the fact that we
  believe in its existence&#8212;these are most important truths; but
  they are not things to take to market in books, and for a like
  reason. They are important things to <i>know</i>, but they are not
  important things to <i>tell</i>. We conceive, in short, that Nature,
  by rendering these and similar truths unreservedly patent to the
  whole human race, has affixed to them her own
  contraband,&#8212;interdicting their communication; and that Dr Reid,
  in making them the staple of his publications, was fighting against
  an eternal law. He undertook to teach the world certain truths
  connected with perception, which by his own admission the world
  already knew just as well as he did&#8212;and which required no
  labour for their production. This way of going to work with any
  problem, is certainly not the best. These remarks settle, we think,
  the general pretensions of the philosophy of Common Sense. In
  justice, however, to this philosophy, we must not omit to mention,
  that Sir William Hamilton has adduced the evidence of no less than
  one hundred and six witnesses, whose testimony goes to establish that
  it is a &#954;&#951;&#956;&#945; &#949;&#962;
  &#945;&#949;&#953;&#8212;a perpetual possession, &quot;a <i>joy</i>
  for ever.&quot;</p>

  <p>The <i>first</i> and <i>third</i> modes of dealing with our
  problem remain to be considered. The first mode ignores the problem
  altogether, it refuses to have any thing to do with it. Perhaps this
  mode is the best of the three. We will not say that it is not: it is
  at any rate preferable to the second. But once admit that philosophy
  is a legitimate occupation, and this mode must be set aside, for it
  is a negation of all philosophy. Every thing depends upon this
  admission. But the admission is, we conceive, a point which has been
  already, and long ago decided. Men must and will philosophise. That
  being the case, the only alternative left is, that we should discuss
  the highest problem of philosophy in the terms of the <i>third</i>
  mode proposed. We have called this the speculative method&#8212;which
  means nothing more than that we should expend upon the investigation
  the uttermost toil and application of thought; and that we should
  estimate the truths which we arrive at, not by the scale of their
  importance, but by the scale of their difficulty of
  attainment,&#8212;of their cost of production. <i>Labour</i>, we
  repeat it, is the standard which measures the value of truth, as well
  as the value of wealth.</p>

  <p>A still more cogent argument in favour of the strictly speculative
  treatment of the problem is this. The problem of perception may be
  said to be a <i>reversed</i> problem. What are the means in every
  other problem, are in <i>this</i> problem the end&#8212;and what is
  the end in every other problem, is in this problem the means. In
  every other problem the solution of the problem is the end
  desiderated: the means are the thinking requisite for its solution.
  But here the case is inverted. In <i>our</i> problem the desiderated
  solution is the means, the end is the development, or, we should
  rather say, the creation of speculative thought&#8212;a kind of
  thought different altogether from ordinary popular thinking.
  &quot;Oh! then,&quot; some one will perhaps exclaim, &quot;after all,
  the whole question about perception resolves it into a <i>mere
  gymnastic</i> of the mind.&quot; Good sir&#8212;do you know what you
  are saying? Do <i>you</i> think that the mind itself is any thing
  except a mere gymnastic of the mind. If you do&#8212;you are most
  deplorably mistaken. Most assuredly the mind only <i>is</i> what the
  mind <i>does</i>. The existence of thought is the exercise of
  thought. Now if this be true, there is the strongest possible reason
  for treating the problem after a purely speculative fashion. The
  problem and its desired solution&#8212;these are only the means which
  enable a new species of thinking, (and that the very highest) viz.
  speculative thinking, to deploy into existence. This deployment is
  the end. But how can this end be attained if we check the speculative
  evolution in its first movements, by throwing ourselves into the arms
  of the <i>apparently</i> Common Sense convictions of Dr Reid? We use
  the word &quot;apparently,&quot; because, in reference to this
  problem, the apparently Common Sense convictions of Dr Reid, are not
  the <i>really</i> Common Sense convictions of mankind. These latter
  can only be got at through the severest discipline of
  speculation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id=
  "Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span></p>

  <p>Our final answer, then, to the question which led us into this
  digression is this:&#8212;It is quite true that the material world
  exists: it is quite true that we believe in this existence, and
  always act in conformity with our faith. Whole books may be written
  in confirmation of these truths. They may be published and paraded in
  a manner which apparently settles the entire problem of perception.
  And yet this is not the right way to go to work. It settles nothing
  but what all men, women, and children have already settled. The
  truths thus formally substantiated were produced without an
  effort&#8212;every one has already got from Nature at least as much
  of them as he cares to have; and therefore, whatever their importance
  may be, they cannot, with any sort of propriety, be made the subjects
  of conveyance from man to man. We must either leave the problem
  altogether alone, (a thing, however, which we should have thought of
  sooner,) or we must adopt the speculative treatment. The argument,
  moreover, contained in the preceding paragraph, appears to render
  this treatment imperative; and accordingly we now return to it, after
  our somewhat lengthened digression.</p>

  <p>We must take up the thread of our discourse at the point where we
  dropped it. The crisis to which the discussion had conducted us was
  this; that the existence of matter could not be believed in <i>at
  all</i>. The psychological analysis necessarily lands us in this
  conclusion: for the psychological analysis gives us, for matter,
  nothing but matter <i>per se</i>. But matter <i>per se</i> is what no
  man does or can believe in. We are reluctant to reiterate the proof;
  but it is this: to believe in the existence of matter <i>per se</i>
  is to believe in the existence of matter liberated from perception;
  but we, cannot believe in the existence of matter liberated from
  perception, for no power of thinking will liberate matter from
  perception; therefore, we cannot believe in the existence of matter
  <i>per se</i>. This argument admits of being exhibited in a still
  more forcible form. We commence with an illustration. If a man
  believes that a thing exists as one thing, he cannot believe that
  this same thing exists as another thing. For instance, if a man
  believes that a tree exists as a tree, he cannot believe that it
  exists as a house. Apply this to the subject in hand. If a man
  believes that matter exists as a thing <i>not</i> disengaged from
  perception, he cannot believe that it exists as a thing
  <i>disengaged</i> from perception. Now, there cannot be a doubt that
  the <i>only</i> kind of matter in which man believes is matter
  <i>not</i> disengaged from perception. He therefore cannot believe in
  matter <i>disengaged</i> from perception. His mind is already
  preoccupied by the belief that matter is <i>this one thing</i>, and,
  therefore, he cannot believe that it is <i>that other thing</i>. His
  faith is, in this instance, forestalled, just as much as his faith is
  forestalled from believing that a tree is a house, when he already
  believes that it is a tree.</p>

  <p>There are two very good reasons, then, why we cannot believe in
  the existence of matter at all, if we accept as our starting point
  the psychological analysis. This analysis gives us, for matter,
  matter <i>per se</i>. But matter <i>per se</i> cannot be believed in;
  1st, because the condition on which the belief depends cannot be
  complied with; and, 2dly, because the matter which we <i>already</i>
  believe in is something quite different from matter <i>per se</i>. In
  trying to believe in the existence of matter <i>per se</i>, we always
  find that we are believing in the existence of <i>something else</i>,
  namely, in the existence of matter <i>cum perceptione</i>. But it is
  not to the psychological analysis that we are indebted for this
  matter, which is something else than matter <i>per se</i>. The
  psychological analysis does its best to annihilate it. It gives us
  nothing but matter <i>per se</i>,&#8212;a thing which neither is nor
  can be believed in. We are thus prevented from believing in the
  existence of <i>any</i> kind of matter. In a word, the psychological
  analysis of the perception of matter necessarily converts who embrace
  it into sceptics or idealists.</p>

  <p>In this predicament what shall we do? Shall we abandon the
  analysis as a treacherous principle, or shall we, with Dr Reid, make
  one more stand in its defence? In order that the analysis may have
  fair play we shall give it another chance, by quoting Mr
  Stewart&#39;s exposition of Reid&#39;s doctrine, which must be
  regarded as a perfectly <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id=
  "Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>faithful representation:&#8212;&quot;Dr
  Reid,&quot; says Mr Stewart, &quot;was the first person who had
  courage to lay completely aside all the common <i>hypothetical</i>
  language concerning perception, and to exhibit <i>the difficulty</i>,
  in all its magnitude, by a plain <i>statement of the fact</i>. To
  what, then, it may be asked, does this statement amount? Merely to
  this; that the mind is so formed that certain impressions produced on
  our organs of sense, by external objects, are <i>followed</i> by
  corresponding sensations, and that these sensations, (which have no
  more resemblance to the qualities of matter, than the words of a
  language have to the things they denote,) are <i>followed</i> by a
  perception of the existence and qualities of the bodies by which the
  impressions are made;&#8212;that all the steps of this process are
  equally incomprehensible.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id=
  "FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class=
  "fnanchor">[25]</a> There are at least two points which are well
  worthy of being attended to in this quotation. <i>First</i>, Mr
  Stewart says that Reid &quot;exhibited the difficulty of the problem
  of perception, in all its magnitude, by a plain statement of
  fact.&quot; What does that mean? It means this; that Reid stated,
  indeed, the fact correctly&#8212;namely, <i>that</i> external objects
  give rise to sensations and perceptions, but that still his statement
  did not penetrate to the heart of the business, but by his own
  admission, left the difficulty undiminished. What difficulty? The
  difficulty as to <i>how</i> external objects give rise to sensations
  and perceptions. Reid did not undertake to settle that point&#8212;a
  wise declinature, in the estimation of Mr Stewart. Now Mr Stewart,
  understanding, as he did, the philosophy of causation, ought to have
  known that every difficulty as to <i>how</i> one thing gives rise to
  another, is purely a difficulty of the mind&#39;s creation, and not
  of nature&#39;s making, and is, therefore, no difficulty at all. Let
  us explain this,&#8212;a man says he knows <i>that</i> fire explodes
  gunpowder; but he does not know <i>how</i> or by what means it does
  this. Suppose, then, he finds out the means, he is still just where
  he was; he must again ask how or by what means these discovered means
  explode the gunpowder; and so on <i>ad infinitum</i>. Now the mind
  may quibble with itself for ever, and <i>make</i> what difficulties
  it pleases in this way; but there is no <i>real</i> difficulty in the
  case. In considering any sequence, we always know the <i>how</i> or
  the means as soon as we know the <i>that</i> or the fact. These means
  may be more proximate or more remote means, but they are invariably
  given either proximately or remotely along with and in the fact. As
  soon as we know <i>that</i> fire explodes gunpowder, we know
  <i>how</i> fire explodes gunpowder,&#8212;for fire is itself the
  means which explodes gunpowder,&#8212;the <i>how</i> by which it is
  ignited. In the same way, <i>if</i> we knew that matter gave rise to
  perception, there would be no difficulty as to <i>how</i> it did so.
  Matter would be itself the means which gave rise to perception. We
  conceive, therefore, that Mr Stewart did not consider what he was
  saying when he affirmed that Reid&#39;s plain statement of facts
  exhibited <i>the difficulty</i> in all its magnitude. If Reid&#39;s
  statement <i>be</i> a statement of fact, all difficulty
  vanishes,&#8212;the question of perception is relieved from every
  species of perplexity. If it <i>be</i> the fact that perception is
  consequent on the presence of matter, Reid must be admitted to have
  explained, to the satisfaction of all mankind, <i>how</i> perception
  is brought about. Matter is itself the means by which it is brought
  about.</p>

  <p><i>Secondly</i>, then&#8212;Is it the fact that matter gives rise
  to perception? That is the question. Is it the fact that these two
  things stand to each other in the relation of antecedent and
  consequent? Reid&#39;s &quot;plain statement of fact,&quot; as
  reported by Mr Stewart, maintains that they do. Reid lays it down as
  a fact, that perceptions <i>follow</i> sensations, that sensations
  <i>follow</i> certain impressions made on our organs of sense by
  external objects, which stand first in the series. The sequence,
  then, is this&#8212;1<i>st</i>, Real external objects; 2<i>d</i>,
  Impressions made on our organs of sense; 3<i>d</i>, Sensations;
  4<i>th</i>, Perceptions. It will simplify the discussion if we leave
  out of account Nos. 2 and 3, limiting ourselves to the statement that
  real objects precede perceptions. This is declared to be a
  fact&#8212;of course an <i>observed</i> <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>fact;
  for a fact can with no sort of propriety be called a fact, unless
  some person or other has <i>observed</i> it. Reid &quot;laid
  completely aside all the common <i>hypothetical</i> language
  concerning perception.&quot; His plain statement (so says Mr Stewart)
  contains nothing but facts&#8212;facts established, of course, by
  observation. It is a fact of observation then, according to Reid,
  that real objects precede perceptions; that perceptions follow when
  real objects are present. Now, when a man proclaims as fact such a
  sequence as this, what must he first of all have done? He must have
  observed the antecedent <i>before</i> it was followed by the
  consequent; he must have observed the cause out of combination with
  the effect; otherwise his statement is a pure hypothesis or fiction.
  For instance, when a man says that a shower of rain (No. 1), is
  followed by a refreshed vegetation (No. 2), he must have observed
  both No. 1 and No. 2, and he must have observed them as two separate
  things. Had he never observed any thing but No. 2 (the refreshed
  vegetation), he might form what conjectures he pleased in regard to
  its antecedent, but he never could lay it down <i>as an observed
  fact</i>, that this antecedent was a shower of rain. In the same way,
  when a man affirms it to be a fact of observation (as Dr Reid does,
  according to Stewart) that material objects are <i>followed</i> by
  perceptions, it is absolutely necessary for the credit of his
  statement that he should have observed this to be the case; that he
  should have observed material objects before they were followed by
  perceptions; that he should have observed the antecedent separate
  from the consequent: otherwise his statement, instead of being
  complimented as a plain statement of fact, must be condemned as a
  tortuous statement of hypothesis. Unless he has observed No. 1 and
  No. 2 in sequence, he is not entitled to declare that this is an
  observed sequence. Now, did Reid, or did any man ever observe matter
  anterior to his perception of it? Had Reid a faculty which enabled
  him to catch matter before it had passed in to perception? Did he
  ever observe it, as Hudibras says, &quot;undressed?&quot; Mr Stewart
  implies that he had such a faculty. But the notion is preposterous.
  No man can observe matter prior to his perception of it; for his
  observation of it presupposes his perception of it. Our observation
  of matter <i>begins</i> absolutely with the perception of it.
  Observation always gives the perception of matter as the <i>first</i>
  term in the series, and not matter itself. To pretend (as Reid and
  Stewart do) that observation can go behind perception, and lay hold
  of matter before it has given rise to perception&#8212;this is too
  ludicrous a doctrine to be even mentioned; and we should not have
  alluded to it, but for the countenance which it has received from the
  two great apostles of common sense.</p>

  <p>This last bold attempt, then, on the part of Reid and Stewart (for
  Stewart adopts the doctrine which he reports) to prop their tottering
  analysis on direct observation and experience, must be pronounced a
  failure. Reid&#39;s &quot;plain statement of fact&quot; is not a
  <i>true</i> statement of <i>observed</i> fact; it is a vicious
  statement of <i>conjectured</i> fact. Observation depones to the
  existence of the perception of matter as the first <i>datum</i> with
  which it has to deal, but it depones to the existence of nothing
  anterior to this.</p>

  <p>But will not abstract thinking bear out the analysis by yielding
  to us matter <i>per se</i> as a legitimate inference of reason? No;
  it will do nothing of the kind. To make good this inference, observe
  what abstract thinking must do. It must bring under the notice of the
  mind matter <i>per se</i> (No. 1) as something which is <i>not</i>
  the perception of it (No. 2): but whenever thought tries to bring No.
  1 under the notice of the mind, it is No. 2 (or the perception of
  matter) which invariably comes. We may ring for No. 1, but No. 2
  always answers the bell. We may labour to construe a tree <i>per
  se</i> to the mind, but what we always <i>do</i> construe to the mind
  is the perception of a tree. What we want is No. 1, but what we
  always get is No. 2. To unravel the thing explicitly&#8212;the manner
  in which we impose upon ourselves is this:&#8212;As explanatory of
  the perceptive process, we construe to our minds <i>two number
  twos</i>, and one of these we <i>call</i> No. 1. For example, we have
  the perception of a tree (No. 2); we wish to think the tree itself
  (No. 1) as that which gives <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252"
  id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>rise to the perception. But this No.
  1 is merely No. 2 over again. <i>It</i> is thought of as the
  perception of a tree, <i>i. e.</i> as No. 2. We <i>call</i> it the
  tree itself, or No. 1; but we <i>think</i> it as the perception of
  the tree, or as No. 2. The first or explanatory term (the matter
  <i>per se</i>) is merely a repetition in thought (though called by a
  different name) of the second term&#8212;the term to be
  explained&#8212;viz. the perception of matter. Abstract thinking,
  then, equally with direct observation, refuses to lend any support to
  the analysis; for a thing cannot be said to be analysed when it is
  merely multiplied or repeated, which is all that abstract thinking
  does in regard to the perception of matter. The matter <i>per se</i>,
  which abstract thinking supposes that it separates from the
  perception of matter, is merely an iteration of the perception of
  matter.</p>

  <p>Our conclusion therefore is, that the analysis of the perception
  of matter into the two things, perception and matter (the ordinary
  psychological principle), must, on all accounts, be abandoned. It is
  both treacherous and impracticable.</p>

  <p>Before proceeding to consider the metaphysical solution of the
  problem, we shall gather up into a few sentences the reasonings which
  in the preceding discussion are diffused over a considerable surface.
  The ordinary, or psychological doctrine of perception, reposes upon
  an analysis of the perception of matter into two separate
  things,&#8212;a modification of our minds (the one thing) consequent
  on the presence of matter <i>per se</i>, which is the other thing.
  This analysis inevitably leads to a theory of representative
  perception, because it yields as its result a proximate and a remote
  object. It is the essence of representationism to recognise both of
  these as instrumental in perception. But representationism leads to
  scepticism&#8212;for it is possible that the remote or real object
  (matter <i>per se</i>), not being an object of consciousness, may not
  be instrumental in the process. Scepticism doubts its
  instrumentality, and, doubting its instrumentality, it, of course,
  doubts its existence; for not being an object of consciousness, its
  existence is only postulated in order to account for something which
  <i>is</i> an object of consciousness, viz. perception. If, therefore,
  we doubt that matter has any hand in bringing about perception, we,
  of course, doubt the existence of matter. This scepticism does.
  Idealism denies its instrumentality and existence. In these
  circumstances what does Dr Reid do? He admits that matter <i>per
  se</i> is not an object of consciousness; but he endeavours to save
  its existence by an appeal to our natural and irresistible belief in
  its existence. But scepticism and idealism doubt and deny the
  existence of matter <i>per se</i>, not merely because it is no object
  of consciousness, but, moreover, because it is no object of belief.
  And in this they are perfectly right. It <i>is</i> no object of
  belief. Dr Reid&#39;s appeal, therefore, goes for nothing. He has put
  into the witness-box a nonentity. And scepticism and idealism are at
  any rate for the present reprieved. But do not scepticism and
  idealism go still further in their denial&#8212;do they not extend it
  from a denial in the existence of matter <i>per se</i>, to a denial
  in the existence of matter altogether? Yes, and they must do this.
  They can only deal with the matter which the psychological analysis
  affords. The only kind of matter which the psychological analysis
  affords is matter <i>per se</i>, and it affords this as all matter
  whatsoever. Therefore, in denying the existence of matter <i>per
  se</i>, scepticism and idealism must deny the existence of matter out
  and out. This, then, is the legitimate <i>terminus</i> to which the
  accepted analysis conducts us. We are all, as we at present stand,
  either sceptics or idealists, every man of us. Shall the analysis,
  then, be given up? Not if it can be substantiated by any good plea:
  for <i>truth</i> must be accepted, be the consequences what they may.
  Can the analysis, then, be made good either by observation or by
  reasoning,&#8212;the only competent authorities, now that belief has
  been declared <i>hors de combat</i>? Stewart says that Reid made it
  good by means of direct observation; but the claim is too ridiculous
  to be listened to for a single instant. We have also shown that
  reasoning is incompetent to make out and support the analysis; and
  therefore our conclusion is, that it falls to the ground as a thing
  altogether impracticable as well as false, and <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>that
  the attempt to re-establish it ought never, on any account, to be
  renewed.</p>
  <hr style='width: 45%;' />

  <p>We have dwelt so long on the exposition of the psychological or
  analytic solution of the problem of perception, that we have but
  little space to spare for the discussion of the metaphysical
  doctrine. We shall unfold it as briefly as we can.</p>

  <p>The principle of the metaphysical doctrine is precisely the
  opposite of the principle of the psychological doctrine. The one
  attempts all analysis; the other forbears from all analysis of the
  given fact&#8212;the perception of matter. And why does metaphysic
  make no attempt to dissect this fact? Simply because the thing cannot
  be done. The fact yields not to the solvent of thought: it yields not
  to the solvent of observation: it yields not to the solvent of
  belief, for man has no belief in the existence of matter from which
  perception (present and remembered) has been withdrawn. An impotence
  of the mind does indeed apparently resolve the supposed synthesis:
  but essential thinking exposes the imposition, restores the divided
  elements to their pristine integrity, and extinguishes the theory
  which would explain the <i>datum</i> by means of the concurrence of a
  subjective or mental, and an objective or material factor. The
  convicted weakness of psychology is thus the root which gives
  strength to metaphysic. The failure of psychology affords to
  metaphysic a foundation of adamant. And perhaps no better or more
  comprehensive description of the object of metaphysical or
  speculative philosophy could be given than this,&#8212;that it is a
  science which exists, and has at all times existed, chiefly for the
  purpose of exposing the vanity and confounding the pretensions of
  what is called the &quot;science of the human mind.&quot; The
  turning-round of thought from psychology to metaphysic is the true
  interpretation of the Platonic conversion of the soul from ignorance
  to knowledge&#8212;from mere opinion to certainty and satisfaction:
  in other words, from a discipline in which the thinking is only
  <i>apparent</i>, to a discipline in which the thinking is
  <i>real</i>. Ordinary observation does not reveal to us the real, but
  only the apparent revolutions of the celestial orbs. We must call
  astronomy to our aid if we would reach the truth. In the same way,
  ordinary or psychological thinking may show us the apparent movements
  of thought&#8212;but it is powerless to decipher the real figures
  described in that mightier than planetary scheme. Metaphysic alone
  can teach us to read aright the intellectual skies. Psychology
  regards the universe of thought from the Ptolemaic point of view,
  making man, as this system made the earth, the centre of the whole:
  metaphysic regards it from the Copernican point of view, making God,
  as this scheme makes the sun, the regulating principle of all. The
  difference is as great between &quot;the science of the human
  mind&quot; and metaphysic, as it is between the Ptolemaic and the
  Copernican astronomy, and it is very much of the same kind.</p>

  <p>But the opposition between psychology and metaphysic, which we
  would at present confine ourselves to the consideration of, is
  this:&#8212;the psychological blindness consists in supposing that
  the analysis so often referred to is practicable, and has been made
  out: the metaphysical insight consists in seeing that the analysis is
  null and impracticable. The superiority of metaphysic, then, does not
  consist in doing, or in attempting more than psychology. It consists
  in seeing that psychology proposes to execute, the impossible, (a
  thing which psychology does not herself see, but persists in
  attempting;) and it consists, moreover, in refraining from this
  audacious attempt, and in adopting a humbler, a less adventurous, and
  a more circumspect method. Metaphysic (viewed in its ideal character)
  aims at nothing but what it can fully overtake. It is quite a mistake
  to imagine that this science proposes to carry a man beyond the
  length of his tether. The psychologist, indeed, launches the mind
  into imaginary spheres; but metaphysic binds it down to the fact, and
  there sternly bids it to abide. <i>That</i> is the profession of the
  metaphysican, considered in his beau-ideal. That, too, is the
  practice (making allowance for the infirmities incident to humanity,
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg
  254]</a></span>and which prevent the ideal from ever being perfectly
  realised)&#8212;the practice of all the true astronomers of thought,
  from Plato down to Schelling and Hegel. If these philosophers
  accomplish more than the psychologist, it is only because they
  attempt much less.</p>

  <p>In taking up the problem of perception all that metaphysic demands
  is the <i>whole</i> given fact. That is her only postulate. And it is
  undoubtedly a stipulation which she is justly entitled to make. Now,
  what is, in this case, the <i>whole</i> given fact? When we perceive
  an object, what is the whole given fact before us? In stating it, we
  must not consult elegance of expression: the whole given fact is
  this,&#8212;&quot;We apprehend the perception of an object.&quot; The
  fact before us is comprehended wholly in that statement, but in
  nothing short of it. Now, does metaphysic give no countenance to an
  analysis of this fact? That is a new question&#8212;a question on
  which we have not yet touched. Observe,&#8212;the fact which
  metaphysic declares to be absolutely unsusceptible of analysis is
  &quot;the perception of matter.&quot; But the fact which we are now
  considering is a totally different fact: it is <i>our apprehension
  of</i> the perception of matter&#8212;and it does not follow that
  metaphysic will also declare this fact to be ultimate and
  indecompoundable. Were metaphysic to do this, it would reduce us to
  the condition of subjective or egoistic idealism. But metaphysic is
  not so absurd. It denies the divisibility of the one fact; but it
  does itself divide the other. And it is perfectly competent for
  metaphysic to do this, inasmuch as &quot;our apprehension of the
  perception of matter&quot; is a different fact from &quot;the
  perception of matter itself.&quot; The former is, in the estimation
  of metaphysic, susceptible of analysis&#8212;the latter is not.
  Metaphysic thus escapes the imputation of leading us into subjective
  idealism. This will become more apparent as we proceed.</p>

  <p>&quot;Our apprehension of the perception of
  matter,&quot;&#8212;this, then, is the whole given fact with which
  metaphysic has to deal. And this fact metaphysic proceeds to analyse
  into a subjective and an objective factor&#8212;giving to the human
  mind that part of the <i>datum</i> which belongs to the human mind,
  and withholding from the human mind that part of the <i>datum</i> to
  which it has no proper or exclusive claim. But at what point in the
  <i>datum</i> does metaphysic insert the dissecting knife, or
  introduce the solvent which is to effect the proposed dualisation? At
  a very different point from that at which psychology insinuates her
  &quot;ineffectual fire.&quot; Psychology cuts down between perception
  and matter, making the former subjective and the latter objective.
  Metaphysic cuts down between &quot;our apprehension&quot;&#8212;and
  &quot;the perception of matter;&quot; making the latter, &quot;the
  perception of matter,&quot; totally objective, and the former,
  &quot;our apprehension,&quot; alone subjective. Admitting, then, that
  the total fact we have to deal with is this, &quot;our apprehension
  of the perception of matter&quot;&#8212;the difference of treatment
  which this fact experiences at the hand of psychology and metaphysic
  is this:&#8212;they both divide the fact; but psychology divides it
  as follows;&#8212;&quot;Our apprehension of the perception
  of&quot;&#8212;that is the subjective part of the
  <i>datum</i>&#8212;the part that belongs to the human
  mind;&#8212;&quot;Matter <i>per se</i>&quot; is the objective part of
  the <i>datum</i>, the part of the <i>datum</i> which exists
  independently of the human mind. Metaphysic divides it at a different
  point, &quot;our apprehension of:&quot; this, according to
  metaphysic, is the subjective part of the process&#8212;it is all
  which can with any propriety be attributed to the human
  mind:&#8212;&quot;the perception of matter,&quot; this is the
  objective part of the <i>datum</i>&#8212;the part of it which exists
  independently of the human mind&#8212;and to the possession of which
  the human mind has no proper claim&#8212;no title at all.</p>

  <p>Before explaining what the grounds are which authorise metaphysic
  in making a division so different from the psychological division of
  the fact which they both discuss, we shall make a few remarks for the
  purpose of extirpating, if possible, any lingering prejudice which
  may still lurk in the reader&#39;s mind in favour of the
  psychological partition.</p>

  <p>According to metaphysic, the perception of matter is not the whole
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg
  255]</a></span>given fact with which we have to deal in working out
  this problem&#8212;(it is not the whole given fact; for, as we have
  said, our apprehension of, or participation in, the perception of
  matter&#8212;this is the whole given fact);&#8212;but the perception
  of matter is the <i>whole objective</i> part of the given fact. But
  it will, perhaps, be asked&#8212;Are there not here two given facts?
  Does not the perception of matter imply two <i>data</i>? Is not the
  perception one given fact, and is not the matter itself another given
  fact&#8212;and are not these two facts perfectly distinct from one
  another? No: it is the false analysis of psychologists which we have
  already exposed that deceives us. But there is another circumstance
  which, perhaps, contributes more than any thing else to assist and
  perpetuate our delusion. This is the construction of language. We
  shall take this opportunity to put the student of philosophy upon his
  guard against its misleading tendency.</p>

  <p>People imagine that because two (or rather three) words are
  employed to denote the fact, (the perception of matter,) that
  therefore there are two separate facts and thoughts corresponding to
  these separate words. But it is a great mistake to suppose that the
  analysis of facts and thoughts necessarily runs parallel with the
  analysis of sounds. Man, as Homer says, is
  &#956;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#968;, or a word-divider; and he often
  carries this propensity so far as to divide words where there is no
  corresponding division of thoughts or of things. This is a very
  convenient practice, in so far as the ordinary business of life is
  concerned: for it saves much circumlocution, much expenditure of
  sound. But it runs the risk of making great havoc with scientific
  thinking; and there cannot be a doubt that it has helped to confirm
  psychology in its worst errors, by leading the unwary thinker to
  suppose that he has got before him a complete fact or thought, when
  he has merely got before him a complete word. There are whole words
  which, taken by themselves, have no thoughts or things corresponding
  to them, any more than there are thoughts and things corresponding to
  each of the separate syllables of which these words are composed. The
  words &quot;perception&quot; and &quot;matter&quot; are cases in
  point. These words have no meaning,&#8212;they have neither facts nor
  thoughts corresponding to them, when taken out of correlation to each
  other. The word &quot;perception&quot; must be supplemented (mentally
  at least) by the words &quot;of matter,&quot; before it has any kind
  of sense&#8212;before it denotes any thing that exists; and in like
  manner the word &quot;matter&quot; must be mentally supplemented by
  the words &quot;perception of,&quot; before it has any kind of sense,
  or denotes any real existence. The psychologist would think it absurd
  if any one were to maintain that there is one separate existence in
  nature corresponding to the syllable <i>mat-</i>, and another
  separate existence corresponding to the syllable <i>ter</i>&#8212;the
  component syllables of the word &quot;matter.&quot; In the estimation
  of the metaphysician, it is just as ridiculous to suppose that there
  is an existing fact or modification in us corresponding to the three
  syllables <i>perception</i>, and a fact or existence in nature
  corresponding to the two syllables <i>matter</i>. The word
  &quot;perception&quot; is merely part of a word which, for
  convenience&#39; sake, is allowed to represent the whole word; and so
  is the word &quot;matter.&quot; The word
  &quot;perception-of-matter&quot; is always the one total
  word&#8212;the word to the mind,&#8212;and the existence which this
  word denotes is a totally objective existence.</p>

  <p>But in these remarks we are reiterating (we hope, however, that we
  are also enforcing) our previous arguments. No power of the mind can
  divide into two facts, or two existences, or two thoughts, that one
  prominent fact which stands forth in its integrity as the
  perception-of-matter. Despite, then, the misleading construction of
  language&#8212;despite the plausible artifices of psychology, we must
  just accept this fact as we find it,&#8212;that is, we must accept it
  indissoluble and entire, and we must keep it indissoluble and entire.
  We have seen what psychology brought us to by tampering with it,
  under the pretence of a spurious, because impracticable analysis.</p>

  <p>We proceed to exhibit the grounds upon which the metaphysician
  claims for the perception of matter a totally objective existence.
  The question may be stated thus: Where are we to place <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>this
  <i>datum</i>? in our minds or <i>out of</i> our minds? We cannot
  place part of it in our own minds, and part of it out of our minds,
  for it has been proved to be not subject to partition. Whereever we
  place it, then, there must we place it whole and undivided. Has the
  perception of matter, then, its proper location in the human mind, or
  has it not? Does its existence depend upon our existence, or has it a
  being altogether independent of us?</p>

  <p>Now that, and that alone, is the point to decide which our natural
  belief should be appealed to; but Dr Reid did not see this. His
  appeal to the conviction of common sense was premature. He appealed
  to this belief without allowing scepticism and idealism to run their
  full course; without allowing them to confound the psychological
  analysis, and thus bring, us back to a better condition by compelling
  us to accept the fact, not as given in the spurious analysis of man,
  but as given in the eternal synthesis of God. The consequence was,
  that Reid&#39;s appeal came to naught. Instead of interrogating our
  belief as to the objective existence of the perception of matter,
  (the proper question,) the question which he brought under its notice
  was the objective existence of matter <i>per se</i>&#8212;matter
  <i>minus</i> perception. Now, matter <i>per se</i>, or <i>minus</i>
  perception, is a thing which no belief will countenance. Reid,
  however, could not admit this. Having appealed to the belief, he was
  compelled to distort its evidence in his own favour, and to force it,
  in spite of itself, to bear testimony to the fact which he wished it
  to establish. Thus Dr Reid&#39;s appeal not only came to naught, but
  being premature, it drove him, as has been said and shown, to falsify
  the primitive convictions of our nature. Scepticism must indeed be
  terrible, when it could thus hurry an honest man into a philosophical
  falsehood.</p>

  <p>The question, then, which we have to refer to our natural belief,
  and abide the answer whatever it may be, is this:&#8212;Is the
  perception of matter (taken in its integrity, as it must be taken,)
  is it a modification of the human mind, or is it not? We answer
  unhesitatingly for ourselves, that <i>our</i> belief is, that it is
  not. This &quot;confession of faith&quot; saves us from the
  imputation of subjective idealism, and we care not what other kind of
  idealism we are charged with. We can think of no sort of evidence to
  prove that the perception of matter is a modification of the human
  mind, or that the human mind is its proper and exclusive abode: and
  all our belief sets in towards the opposite conclusion. Our primitive
  conviction, when we do nothing to pervert it, is that the perception
  of matter is not, either wholly, or in part, a condition of the human
  soul; is not bounded in any direction by the narrow limits of our
  intellectual span, but that it &quot;dwells apart,&quot; a mighty and
  independent system, a city fitted up and upheld by the everlasting
  God. Who told us that we were placed in a world composed of matter,
  which gives rise to our subsequent internal perceptions of it, and
  not that we were let down at once into a universe composed of
  external perceptions of matter, that were there beforehand and from
  all eternity&#8212;and in which we, the creatures of a day, are
  merely allowed to participate by the gracious Power to whom they
  really appertain? We, perversely philosophising, told ourselves the
  former of these alternatives; but our better nature, the convictions
  that we have received from God himself, assure us that the latter of
  them is the truth. The latter is by far the simpler, as well as by
  far the sublimer doctrine. But it is not on the authority either of
  its simplicity or its sublimity, that we venture to propound
  it&#8212;it is on account of its perfect consonance, both with the
  primitive convictions of our unsophisticated common sense, and with
  the more delicate and complex evidence of our speculative reason.</p>

  <p>When a man consults his own nature, in an impartial spirit, he
  inevitably finds that his genuine belief in the existence of matter
  is not a belief in the independent existence of matter <i>per
  se</i>&#8212;but is a belief in the independent existence of the
  perception of matter which he is for the time participating in. The
  very last thing which he naturally believes in, is, that the
  perception is a state of his own mind, and that the matter is
  something different from it, and exists apart <i>in naturÃ¢ rerum</i>.
  He <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg
  257]</a></span>they <i>say</i> that he believes this, but he never
  does really believe it. At any rate, he believes in the <i>first</i>
  place that they exist <i>together</i>, wherever they exist. The
  perception which a man has of a sheet of paper, does not come before
  him as something distinct from the sheet of paper itself. The two are
  identical: they are indivisible: they are not two, but one. The only
  question then is, whether the perception of a sheet of paper (taken
  as it must be in its indissoluble totality) is a state of the
  man&#39;s own mind&#8212;or is no such state. And, in settlement of
  this question, there cannot be a doubt that he believes in the
  <i>second</i> place, that the perception of a sheet of paper is not a
  modification of his own mind, but is an objective thing which exists
  altogether independent of him, and one which would still exist,
  although he, and all other created beings were annihilated. All that
  he believes to be his (or subjective) is <i>his participation in</i>
  the perception of this object. In a word, it is the perception of
  matter, and not matter <i>per se</i>, which is the <i>kind</i> of
  matter, in the independent and permanent existence of which man rests
  and reposes his belief. There is no truth or satisfaction to be found
  in any other doctrine.</p>

  <p>This metaphysical theory of perception is a doctrine of pure
  intuitionism: it steers clear of all the perplexities of
  representationism; for it gives us in perception only one&#8212;that
  is, only a proximate object: this object is the perception of
  matter,&#8212;and this is one indivisible object. It is not, and
  cannot be, split into a proximate and a remote object. The doctrine,
  therefore, is proof against all the cavils of scepticism. We may add,
  that the entire objectivity of this <i>datum</i> (which the
  metaphysical doctrine proclaims) makes it proof against the
  imputation of idealism,&#8212;at least of every species of absurd or
  objectionable idealism.</p>

  <p>But what are these objective perceptions of matter, and to whom do
  they belong? This question leads us to speak of the circumstance
  which renders the metaphysical doctrine of perception so truly
  valuable. This doctrine is valuable chiefly on account of the
  indestructible foundation which it affords to the <i>Ã  priori</i>
  argument in favour of the existence of God. The substance of the
  argument is this,&#8212;matter is the perception of matter. The
  perception of matter does not belong to man; it is no state of the
  human mind,&#8212;man merely participates in it. But it must belong
  to some mind,&#8212;for perceptions without an intelligence in which
  they inhere are, inconceivable and contradictory. They must therefore
  be the property of the Divine mind; states of the everlasting
  intellect; <i>ideas</i> of the Lord and Ruler of all things, and
  which come before us as <i>realities</i>,&#8212;so forcibly do they
  contrast themselves with the evanescent and irregular ideas of our
  feeble understandings. We must, however, beware, above all things, of
  regarding these Divine ideas as <i>mere</i> ideas. An idea, as
  usually understood, is that from which all reality has been
  abstracted; but the perception of matter is a Divine idea, from which
  the reality has not been abstracted, and from which it cannot be
  abstracted.</p>

  <p>But what, it will be asked&#8212;what becomes of the senses if
  this doctrine be admitted? What is their use and office? Just the
  same as before,&#8212;only with this difference, that whereas the
  psychological doctrine teaches that the exercise of the senses is the
  condition upon which we are permitted to apprehend objective material
  things&#8212;the metaphysical doctrine teaches that the exercise of
  the senses is the condition upon which we are permitted to apprehend
  or participate in the objective perception of material things. There
  is no real difficulty in the question just raised; and therefore,
  with this explanatory hint, we leave it, our space being
  exhausted.</p>

  <p>Anticipations of this doctrine are to be found in the writings of
  every great metaphysician&#8212;of every man that ever speculated. It
  is announced in the speculations of Malebranche&#8212;still more
  explicitly in those of Berkeley; but though it forms the substance of
  their systems, from foundation-stone to pinnacle, it is not
  proclaimed with sufficiently unequivocal distinctness by either of
  these two great philosophers. Malebranche made the perception of
  matter totally objective, and vested the perception in the Divine
  mind, as we do. But he erred in this <span class='pagenum'><a name=

  perception of matter altogether objective, he analysed it in its
  objectivity into perception (<i>idÃ©e</i>) and matter <i>per se</i>.
  We should rather say that he attempted to do this: and of course he
  failed, for the thing, as we have shown, is absolutely impossible.
  Berkeley made no such attempt. He regarded the perception of matter
  as not only totally objective, but as absolutely indivisible; and
  therefore we are disposed to regard him as the greatest metaphysician
  of his own country&#8212;(we do not mean Ireland; but England,
  Scotland, and Ireland)&#8212;at the very least.</p>

  <p>When this elaborate edition of Reid&#39;s works shall be
  completed&#8212;shall have received its last consummate polish from
  the hand of its accomplished editor&#8212;we promise to review the
  many important topics (partly philosophical and partly physiological)
  which Sir William Hamilton has discussed in a manner which is worthy
  of his own great reputation, and which renders all compliment
  superfluous. We are assured that the philosophical public is waiting
  with anxious impatience for the completion of these discussions. In
  the mean time, we heartily recommend the volume to the student of
  philosophy as one of the most important works which our higher
  literature contains, and as one from which he will derive equal
  gratification and instruction, whether he agrees with its contents or
  not.</p>

      the first.</i> He was not <i>the</i> first. Berkeley had preceded
      him in denouncing most unequivocally the whole theory of
      representationism. The reason why Berkeley does not get the
      credit of this is, because his performance is even more explicit
      and cogent than his promise. He made no phrase about refuting the
      theory&#8212;he simply refuted it. Reid <i>said</i> the
      business&#8212;but Berkeley <i>did</i> it. The two greatest and
      most unaccountable blunders in the whole history of philosophy
      are, probably Reid&#39;s allegations that Berkeley was a
      representationist, and that he was an idealist; understanding by
      the word <i>idealist</i>, one who denies the existence of a real
      external universe. From every page of his writings, it is obvious
      that Berkeley was neither the one of these nor the other, even in
      the remotest degree.</p>

      that is no fault of his, but of those at whose hands he received

  our last Number, and to</i> PROFESSOR WILSON&#39;S <i>Letter to the
  Editor of the Edinburgh Evening Courant, dated 30th June.</i></p>

  <p>MESSRS BLACKWOOD regret to find that some observations regarding
  the University of Edinburgh, contained in an article in their last
  Number, should have occasioned feelings of pain and disapprobation in
  one of their earliest and best supporters, Professor Wilson, of whose
  connexion with the Magazine they are justly proud, and whose
  friendship they hope ever to retain undiminished.</p>

  <p>These observations did not at the time appear to them in the
  aspect in which they now see that they may be regarded. They were
  fully assured of the meaning and motives of the writer of the article
  in question, and conscious themselves of the deepest respect and
  admiration for the University of Edinburgh.</p>

  <p>They are now, however, sensible that the passage referred to was
  liable to objections which they know had not occurred to the writer
  of the article, but which they, as the parties who have all along
  been responsible for the management of the Magazine, ought to have
  seen and obviated.</p>

  <p>They deeply regret that through this error upon their part
  Professor Wilson should have felt it necessary to disclaim what had
  thus inadvertently been allowed to appear in their pages.</p>
